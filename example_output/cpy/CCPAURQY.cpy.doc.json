The message type and source (PA-RQ-MESSAGE-TYPE, PA-RQ-MESSAGE-SOURCE) along with processing code (PA-RQ-PROCESSING-CODE) and acquirer country code (PA-RQ-ACQR-COUNTRY-CODE) provide additional context for the authorization request. The POS entry mode (PA-RQ-POS-ENTRY-MODE) indicates how the transaction was initiated. No specific business logic or error handling is present within this data definition section. This section does not call any other paragraphs or programs; its sole purpose is to define the data structure.",
