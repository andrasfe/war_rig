It is a 6-byte alphanumeric field (PIC X(06)) that stores the date when the authorization was requested or granted. The format of the date is not explicitly specified within the copybook, but it is likely to be in a standard format such as YYMMDD or MMDDYY. This field is part of the larger pending authorization request data structure defined in the copybook. It is used in conjunction with other fields like PA-RQ-AUTH-TIME to uniquely identify and timestamp the authorization request. The value of this field would be populated by the calling program or system that generates the authorization request. It does not perform any calculations or validations itself.",
