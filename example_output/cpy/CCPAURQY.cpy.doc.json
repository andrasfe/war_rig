    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines a level-05 group structure named implicitly under PA-RQ-* fields for a Pending Authorization Request record. It specifies 18 elementary data items including authorization date/time (lines 19-20), card number and expiry (21,23), transaction details (26-27,36), merchant category and ID (28,31), and location data (32-35). The structure standardizes data for payment authorization queries in mainframe applications.",
