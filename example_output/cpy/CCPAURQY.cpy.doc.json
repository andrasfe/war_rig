    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines a data structure at the 05 group level for a 'PENDING AUTHORIZATION REQUEST' used in payment processing systems. It specifies 18 elementary fields including timestamps (auth date/time), card details (number, expiry, type), transaction data (amount, ID, processing code), message metadata (type, source), and merchant information (ID, name, city, state, zip, category code, acquirer country). The structure ensures consistent data formatting via PIC clauses for use in COBOL programs handling credit card authorizations.",
