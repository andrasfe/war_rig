## Purpose

This copybook defines the data structure for the PADFL Program Communication Block (PCB), a standard IMS DL/I structure used for database access and navigation. It includes fields for database name (DBDNAME), current segment level, PCB status, processing options, segment name, key feedback name and count, and a key feedback buffer. This structure is typically included in the LINKAGE SECTION of IMS programs to receive status and positioning information from DL/I calls.

**Business Context**: IMS hierarchical database (DL/I) access and navigation in mainframe batch or online programs
