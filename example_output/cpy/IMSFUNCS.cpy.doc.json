    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines a data structure FUNC-CODES containing constants for IMS DL/I function codes used in database calls, such as 'GU  ' for Get Unique, 'GHU ' for Get Hold Unique, 'GN  ' for Get Next, and others up to 'DLET' for Delete. It also defines PARMCOUNT as a 5-digit signed binary field initialized to +4, likely representing the expected number of parameters for IMS calls. The copybook is intended for inclusion in COBOL programs performing IMS database operations.",
