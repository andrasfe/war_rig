    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines the FUNC-CODES group (01 level) containing elementary 05-level constant function codes for IMS DL/I database calls, including Get Unique (GU), Get Hold Unique (GHU), Get Next (GN), Get Hold Next (GHN), Get Next Parent (GNP), Get Hold Next Parent (GHNP), Replace (REPL), Insert (ISRT), and Delete (DLET). It also defines PARMCOUNT as a constant numeric value of 4 in S9(05) COMP-5 format, likely specifying the expected parameter count for certain IMS calls. These constants are intended to be copied into COBOL programs for standardized IMS DL/I PCB mask function codes.",
