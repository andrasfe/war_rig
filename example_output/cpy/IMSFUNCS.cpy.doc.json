    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines a data structure FUNC-CODES containing standardized 4-character IMS DL/I function codes for database operations including Get Unique (GU), Get Hold Unique (GHU), Get Next (GN), Get Hold Next (GHN), Get Next within Parent (GNP), Get Hold Next within Parent (GHNP), Replace (REPL), Insert (ISRT), and Delete (DLET). It also defines a PARMCOUNT field with an initial value of 4 in COMP-5 format, likely specifying the number of parameters for IMS calls. These constants are used in programs performing IMS database access to ensure consistent function code values.",
