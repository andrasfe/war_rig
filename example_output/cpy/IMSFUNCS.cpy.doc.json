Each function code is a 4-character alphanumeric field initialized with a specific value representing an IMS command. These commands include 'GU' (Get Unique), 'GHU' (Get Hold Unique), 'GN' (Get Next), 'GHN' (Get Hold Next), 'GNP' (Get Next within Parent), 'GHNP' (Get Hold Next within Parent), 'REPL' (Replace), 'ISRT' (Insert), and 'DLET' (Delete). These codes are used as parameters when calling IMS subroutines to specify the desired database operation. The values are directly assigned within the copybook and are intended to be used as read-only constants within the calling program.
