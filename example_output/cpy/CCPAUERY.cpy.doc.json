It captures key error details such as date (ERR-DATE), time (ERR-TIME), application (ERR-APPLICATION), program (ERR-PROGRAM), location (ERR-LOCATION), severity level (ERR-LEVEL with 88 condition names for LOG, INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL), subsystem (ERR-SUBSYSTEM with 88 conditions for APP, CICS, IMS, DB2, MQ, FILE), error codes (ERR-CODE-1, ERR-CODE-2), message (ERR-MESSAGE), and event key (ERR-EVENT-KEY). The structure is intended for use in error logging by mainframe applications.",
