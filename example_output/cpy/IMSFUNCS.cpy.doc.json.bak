The primary content is the 01 FUNC-CODES group at line 17, which holds all function code constants and PARMCOUNT. No runtime inputs are consumed, as fields are initialized with VALUE clauses at compile time. Outputs consist of these constants available for MOVE operations into IMS CALL parameters like the function code field in the PCB mask. There is no business logic, conditional decisions, or validations implemented, as it is a static definition module. No error handling mechanisms are present. It does not invoke any other paragraphs or external programs. Typically included via COPY IMSFUNCS. in WORKING-STORAGE of IMS-enabled COBOL programs to ensure consistent function code usage across the application.",

Additionally, PARMCOUNT is defined as PIC S9(05) VALUE +4 COMP-5 (line 27), specifying the standard 4-parameter count for IMS calls. No inputs are read at runtime; values are static. Outputs are the constant values for assignment to DL/I call parameters. No decisions, loops, or business rules are applied. No error handling or validations occur. No subordinate calls to paragraphs or programs are made, serving purely as a reference data cluster.",
