    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines the ERROR-LOG-RECORD level-01 data structure for capturing details of errors in pending authorization processes. It includes fields for timestamp (ERR-DATE, ERR-TIME), application identifiers (ERR-APPLICATION, ERR-PROGRAM), location (ERR-LOCATION), severity level (ERR-LEVEL with 88 conditions), subsystem (ERR-SUBSYSTEM with 88 conditions), error codes (ERR-CODE-1, ERR-CODE-2), message (ERR-MESSAGE), and event key (ERR-EVENT-KEY). The structure supports standardized error logging across mainframe applications.",
