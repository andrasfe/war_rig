It includes fields for error date (PIC X(06)), time (PIC X(06)), application (PIC X(08)), program (PIC X(08)), location (PIC X(04)), level (PIC X(01)) with 88 levels for LOG/I/WARNING/CRITICAL, subsystem (PIC X(01)) with 88 levels for APP/CICS/IMS/DB2/MQ/FILE, two error codes (PIC X(09) each), message (PIC X(50)), and event key (PIC X(20)). The structure standardizes error logging across mainframe applications.",
