It includes fields for database name (PADFL-DBDNAME), segment level (PADFL-SEG-LEVEL), PCB status (PADFL-PCB-STATUS), processing options (PADFL-PCB-PROCOPT), segment name (PADFL-SEG-NAME), key feedback name offset (PADFL-KEYFB-NAME), number of sensitive segments (PADFL-NUM-SENSEGS), and key feedback buffer (PADFL-KEYFB). A filler field is present between PROCOPT and SEG-NAME.",
