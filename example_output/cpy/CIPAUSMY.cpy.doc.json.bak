It contains various fields related to customer accounts and their authorization activities. The PA-ACCT-ID field stores the account identifier as a COMP-3 packed decimal. PA-CUST-ID holds the customer identifier. PA-AUTH-STATUS indicates the overall authorization status. PA-ACCOUNT-STATUS is an array that stores up to 5 account statuses. PA-CREDIT-LIMIT and PA-CASH-LIMIT define the credit and cash limits for the account, respectively. PA-CREDIT-BALANCE and PA-CASH-BALANCE represent the current credit and cash balances. PA-APPROVED-AUTH-CNT and PA-DECLINED-AUTH-CNT store the counts of approved and declined authorizations. PA-APPROVED-AUTH-AMT and PA-DECLINED-AUTH-AMT store the total amounts of approved and declined authorizations. Finally, FILLER provides padding to ensure the segment has a fixed length. This data structure is likely used by IMS transactions to retrieve and update pending authorization information.",
