It includes fields related to the credit card number (PA-RL-CARD-NUM), transaction identifier (PA-RL-TRANSACTION-ID), authorization identification code (PA-RL-AUTH-ID-CODE), authorization response code (PA-RL-AUTH-RESP-CODE), authorization response reason (PA-RL-AUTH-RESP-REASON), and the approved amount (PA-RL-APPROVED-AMT). The PA-RL-CARD-NUM field stores the card number as a 16-character alphanumeric string. The PA-RL-TRANSACTION-ID field stores the transaction ID as a 15-character alphanumeric string. The PA-RL-AUTH-ID-CODE field stores the authorization ID code as a 6-character alphanumeric string. The PA-RL-AUTH-RESP-CODE field stores the authorization response code as a 2-character alphanumeric string. The PA-RL-AUTH-RESP-REASON field stores the authorization response reason as a 4-character alphanumeric string. The PA-RL-APPROVED-AMT field stores the approved amount as a signed numeric value with 10 digits before the decimal and 2 digits after the decimal. This data structure is likely used to pass authorization response information between different modules or programs within a transaction processing system. No specific business logic or error handling is present within this data definition. No paragraphs or programs are called from within this section.",
