It includes fields for card number (16 chars), transaction ID (15 chars), auth ID code (6 chars), auth response code (2 chars), auth response reason (4 chars), and approved amount (signed numeric with 10 integer digits, 2 decimals). This structure holds response data from payment authorization requests, as indicated by the header comments.",
