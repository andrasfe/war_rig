    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines the data structure for a Pending Authorization Response record. It consists of six elementary 05-level fields: PA-RL-CARD-NUM (PIC X(16)), PA-RL-TRANSACTION-ID (PIC X(15)), PA-RL-AUTH-ID-CODE (PIC X(06)), PA-RL-AUTH-RESP-CODE (PIC X(02)), PA-RL-AUTH-RESP-REASON (PIC X(04)), and PA-RL-APPROVED-AMT (PIC +9(10).99). As a copybook, it provides reusable data definitions for use in COBOL programs handling authorization responses; no executable logic is present.",
