    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines a level-05 data structure named PA-RLY for a Pending Authorization Response, consisting of card number, transaction ID, authorization ID code, authorization response code, response reason, and approved amount fields. It is intended to be included via COPY statement in COBOL programs to standardize the layout of authorization response data. The structure supports payment processing workflows involving authorization requests.",
