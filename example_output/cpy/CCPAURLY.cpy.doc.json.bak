The primary purpose is to provide a standardized structure for representing authorization data within a COBOL program. It consumes no direct input but defines the structure for data that will be populated from external sources or other program variables. It produces a structured data layout that can be used for storing and manipulating authorization information. No specific business logic or error handling is present within the copybook itself, as it only defines data structures. It does not call any other paragraphs or programs directly, but the defined data structure will be used by other parts of the application. The data elements defined include the card number (PA-RL-CARD-NUM), transaction ID (PA-RL-TRANSACTION-ID), authorization ID code (PA-RL-AUTH-ID-CODE), authorization response code (PA-RL-AUTH-RESP-CODE), authorization response reason (PA-RL-AUTH-RESP-REASON), and the approved amount (PA-RL-APPROVED-AMT). These fields are used to represent the details of an authorization response received from a payment processor.",
