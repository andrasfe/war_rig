      "purpose": "This is the primary data structure definition in the CCPAURLY copybook, representing an implied level 01 group named CCPAURLY for Pending Authorization Response. Its role is to provide a reusable data layout for programs processing authorization responses in transaction systems. It defines six subordinate 05-level fields that collectively hold the response data, with no executable code present. It consumes no runtime inputs as it is a compile-time data definition copied into other programs. It produces a fixed memory layout for variables used across programs for storing or passing auth response details. No business logic, decisions, or conditions are implemented since it contains only PIC clauses. No error handling or validation is performed within the copybook itself. It calls no other paragraphs or programs. When copied into a program, the fields are populated via MOVE, ACCEPT, or file I/O operations in the host program.",

The field produces a fixed-length string value for the card number, used in matching or logging. No business logic or decisions are made here as it is purely a data definition. No conditions are checked or transformations applied within the copybook. No error handling is defined for this field. It calls no other paragraphs or programs.
