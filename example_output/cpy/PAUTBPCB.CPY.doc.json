It includes fields for DBD name (line 18), segment level (line 19), PCB status code (line 20), processing options (line 21), segment name (line 23), key feedback offset (line 24), number of sensitive segments (line 25), and key feedback buffer (line 26). Used in IMS-enabled COBOL programs to receive status and positioning information from DL/I calls.",
