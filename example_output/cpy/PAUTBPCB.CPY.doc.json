It includes standard IMS DBPCB fields such as DBD name, segment level and name, PCB status and processing options, number of sensitive segments, and a key feedback buffer area. This structure is used in COBOL programs (typically in the LINKAGE SECTION) to interface with IMS DL/I calls for database navigation and access.",
