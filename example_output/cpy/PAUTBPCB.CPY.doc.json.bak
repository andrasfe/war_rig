      "purpose": "This copybook defines the data structure PAUTBPCB, which is likely used to hold information related to an IMS Program Communication Block (PCB). The structure contains fields that describe the database (PAUT-DBDNAME), segment level (PAUT-SEG-LEVEL), PCB status (PAUT-PCB-STATUS), processing options (PAUT-PCB-PROCOPT), and segment name (PAUT-SEG-NAME). It also includes fields for key feedback name (PAUT-KEYFB-NAME), the number of sensitive segments (PAUT-NUM-SENSEGS), and the key feedback itself (PAUT-KEYFB). This copybook does not perform any processing or logic itself; it merely defines a data structure that other programs can use to access and manipulate PCB-related data. The fields within PAUTBPCB are used to store information retrieved from or passed to IMS during database operations. The copybook is intended to be included in the WORKING-STORAGE SECTION or LINKAGE SECTION of a COBOL program that interacts with an IMS database.",
