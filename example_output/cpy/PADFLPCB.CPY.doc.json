    "summary": "This copybook defines the PADFLPCB level-01 record structure, which represents the Program Communication Block (PCB) for the PADFL IMS database used in DL/I calls. It includes fields for database name (DBDNAME), segment level, PCB status, processing options, segment name, key feedback name, number of sensitive segments, and the key feedback buffer. The structure follows standard IMS DB PCB layout for facilitating database navigation and access in COBOL programs.",
