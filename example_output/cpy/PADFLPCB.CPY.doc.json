    "summary": "This copybook defines the PADFLPCB group structure (line 17), which maps an IMS Database Program Communication Block (DBPCB) used in COBOL programs for IMS DL/I database access. It includes standard DBPCB fields such as DBD name (line 18), segment level (line 19), PCB status (line 20), processing options (line 21), segment name (line 23), key feedback details (lines 24-26), and a key feedback buffer (line 26). As a copybook, it provides data definitions for IMS PCB handling and contains no executable logic.",
