The PADFL-DBDNAME field stores the name of the IMS database being accessed. The PADFL-SEG-LEVEL indicates the hierarchical level of the segment being processed. PADFL-PCB-STATUS provides status information about the PCB. PADFL-PCB-PROCOPT specifies the processing options for the PCB. PADFL-SEG-NAME stores the name of the segment being accessed. PADFL-KEYFB-NAME stores the name of the key feedback area. PADFL-NUM-SENSEGS indicates the number of sensitive segments. PADFL-KEYFB contains the key feedback information.
