It includes fields for DBD name, segment level, PCB status, processing options, a filler field, current segment name, key feedback name, number of sensitive segments, and a key feedback buffer. This structure is referenced in the LINKAGE SECTION of IMS DL/I COBOL programs to receive status codes and key feedback data from IMS after database calls.",
