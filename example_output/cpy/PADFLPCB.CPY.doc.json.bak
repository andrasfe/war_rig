It specifies fields including database name (PADFL-DBDNAME, line 18), segment level (line 19), PCB status (line 20), processing options (line 21), segment name (line 23), key feedback name offset (line 24), number of sensitive segments (line 25), and key feedback buffer (line 26). This structure is used in IMS DL/I programs to obtain status and navigation information during database calls.",
