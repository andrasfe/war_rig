      "purpose": "PADFLPCB is the primary level-01 data structure defined in this copybook (lines 17-26), serving as the IMS Database PCB (DBPCB) mapping for DL/I database interactions. Its role is to provide symbolically named fields overlaying the fixed binary layout of the PCB supplied by IMS to the application program. It consumes no runtime inputs itself, as the fields are populated by the IMS control region during program execution and after each DL/I call. The structure produces accessible output fields for the program to read, including PADFL-DBDNAME (line 18, PIC X(08), the 8-character database name), PADFL-SEG-LEVEL (line 19, PIC X(02), the 2-character current segment level returned by IMS), PADFL-PCB-STATUS (line 20, PIC X(02), 2-character PCB status such as spaces for success, 'GE' for database end, 'IK' for key invalid), PADFL-PCB-PROCOPT (line 21, PIC X(04), 4-character processing options like 'GO  ' for get unique), FILLER (line 22, PIC S9(05) COMP, reserved or alignment bytes), PADFL-SEG-NAME (line 23, PIC X(08), 8-character feedback name of the segment retrieved), PADFL-KEYFB-NAME (line 24, PIC S9(05) COMP, offset or identifier for first key feedback field name), PADFL-NUM-SENSEGS (line 25, PIC S9(05) COMP, number of parent-sensitive segments for this PCB), and PADFL-KEYFB (line 26, PIC X(255), variable-length key feedback area containing concatenated key values from IMS). No business logic, conditions, or decisions are implemented, as this is a pure data definition with no executable statements. There is no error handling defined within the structure; error checking is performed by the using program inspecting fields like PADFL-PCB-STATUS post-DL/I call. No paragraphs or external programs are called or invoked from here, as it is not procedural code. Typically copied into the LINKAGE SECTION of an IMS application for direct access to IMS-provided PCB data.",
