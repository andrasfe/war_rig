## Purpose

This copybook defines the PAUTBPCB data structure, which appears to be related to IMS PCB (Program Communication Block) information based on the field names. It includes fields for DBD name, segment level, PCB status, processing options, segment name, key feedback name, number of sensitive segments, and key feedback area. The copybook is likely used to access and manipulate IMS database information within a COBOL program.
