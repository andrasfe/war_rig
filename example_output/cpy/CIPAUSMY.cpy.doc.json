The PA-ACCOUNT-STATUS field is defined as an array of 5 two-character fields, allowing for multiple account statuses to be stored. The segment is intended to hold information about pending authorizations for an account, including limits, balances, and authorization history. No specific business logic or error handling is present within this copybook, as it only defines the data structure. There are no calls to other paragraphs or programs within this copybook.",
