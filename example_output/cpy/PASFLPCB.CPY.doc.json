The copybook's purpose is solely to define the layout of the PASFLPCB data structure, which likely holds information about an IMS database PCB. This structure includes fields for the database name (PASFL-DBDNAME), segment level (PASFL-SEG-LEVEL), PCB status (PASFL-PCB-STATUS), processing options (PASFL-PCB-PROCOPT), segment name (PASFL-SEG-NAME), key feedback name (PASFL-KEYFB-NAME), number of sensitive segments (PASFL-NUM-SENSEGS), and a key feedback area (PASFL-KEYFB). These fields are used by programs interacting with an IMS database to understand the current state and characteristics of the database and the program's access to it. The copybook is included in the WORKING-STORAGE section of COBOL programs that need to access or manipulate this PCB information.",
