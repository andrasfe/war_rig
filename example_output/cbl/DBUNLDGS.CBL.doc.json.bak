For each root segment retrieved successfully where PA-ACCT-ID is numeric, it inserts the summary segment into the PASFL GSAM database and then retrieves and inserts all associated child detail segments into the PADFL GSAM database. Root segments with non-numeric PA-ACCT-ID are read and counted but skipped for insertion and child processing.",
