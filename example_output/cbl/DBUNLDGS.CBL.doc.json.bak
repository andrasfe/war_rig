Within the loop, each root summary is read, validated (numeric acct ID), inserted to PASFL GSAM, and its children processed similarly to PADFL GSAM. Counters like WS-AUTH-SMRY-PROC-CNT and WS-NO-SUMRY-READ are incremented during reads. No direct data inputs beyond PCBs; outputs are GSAM inserts handled in subordinates. Error handling is delegated to called paragraphs which abend on IMS failures. After loop completion, it performs 4000-FILE-CLOSE for cleanup display (no actual files).
