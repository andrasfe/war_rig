It begins by calling 1000-INITIALIZE to set up the program environment and read input parameters. Then, it enters a loop that continues until either an error flag is set or the end of the authorization database is reached. Inside this loop, it calls 3000-FIND-NEXT-AUTH-DTL to retrieve the next authorization detail record. Another nested loop iterates through the detail records associated with the current summary record, calling 4000-CHECK-IF-EXPIRED to determine if the detail record has expired. If a detail record is expired (QUALIFIED-FOR-DELETE is true), 5000-DELETE-AUTH-DTL is called to delete the detail record from the database. After processing all detail records for a summary record, the program checks if both the approved and declined authorization counts in the summary record are zero. If so, it calls 6000-DELETE-AUTH-SUMMARY to delete the summary record. Finally, before retrieving the next summary record, the program checks if the number of processed summary records exceeds the checkpoint frequency specified in the input parameters. If it does, 9000-TAKE-CHECKPOINT is called to take a checkpoint and reset the summary record count. Once all summary records have been processed, the program calls 9000-TAKE-CHECKPOINT one last time and then terminates.",
