    "summary": "This batch COBOL program loads pending authorization data into an IMS hierarchical database by reading root segments (PAUTSUM0) from sequential file INFILE1 and inserting them via IMS ISRT calls, then reading child segments (PAUTDTL1) from INFILE2, qualifying by root key, performing GU on the root, and inserting the children via ISRT. It handles file I/O status checks and IMS PCB feedback status, abending on errors other than successful insert or duplicate (II). The program uses unqualified SSA for root inserts and child inserts, qualified SSA for root GU.",

After exhausting roots, it enters another loop performing 3000-READ-CHILD-SEG-FILE until END-CHILD-SEG-FILE = 'Y', processing child segments from INFILE2 by GU-ing the parent root and inserting children. Upon completion of both loops, it performs 4000-FILE-CLOSE to shut down files with status checks. No explicit error handling beyond abends in subordinates; it relies on flags set in child paragraphs.
