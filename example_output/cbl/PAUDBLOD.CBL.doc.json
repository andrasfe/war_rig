Then, it enters a loop that reads records from INFILE1 (root segments) using 2000-READ-ROOT-SEG-FILE until the end of the file is reached. Subsequently, it enters another loop to read records from INFILE2 (child segments) using 3000-READ-CHILD-SEG-FILE until the end of that file is reached. Finally, it calls 4000-FILE-CLOSE to close the input files before terminating the program with a GOBACK statement. The paragraph uses flags END-ROOT-SEG-FILE and END-CHILD-SEG-FILE to control the read loops and calls subroutines to handle file I/O and IMS database operations.",
