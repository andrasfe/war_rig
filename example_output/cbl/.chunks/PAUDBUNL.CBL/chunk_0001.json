        "purpose": "The 9999-ABEND paragraph serves as the primary abnormal termination handler for the PAUDBUNL program, invoked when a critical error requires program abend. It consumes no specific inputs or data from files or variables, relying instead on being PERFORMed from error conditions elsewhere in the program. The outputs produced include a DISPLAY message 'IMSUNLOD ABENDING ...' sent to the system console or SYSOUT (line 4), and modification of the RETURN-CODE field to 16 (line 6). No business logic or conditional decisions are implemented within this paragraph; it unconditionally performs termination actions. Error handling is inherent as this is the abend routine itself, with no further validation or recovery attempted. This paragraph calls no other paragraphs or external programs. Following the DISPLAY and MOVE, it executes GOBACK (line 7) to end program execution and propagate the return code. Comments above the DISPLAY provide section headers but no additional logic (lines 2-3). The paragraph's role is strictly to ensure a consistent abend with logging and non-zero return code.",

There is no business logic, conditions, validations, or decisions implemented here. Error handling is not applicable as this is a standard exit routine. This paragraph calls no other paragraphs or programs. Its sole action is to execute the EXIT statement (line 10), which returns control to the invoking section or ends the routine. This ensures proper flow control without abrupt termination. The paragraph label is at line 9.",
