        "purpose": "This paragraph serves as the program's abnormal termination handler, invoked when a fatal error occurs elsewhere in the program. It consumes no specific inputs or data, relying instead on the program's current state such as the RETURN-CODE field. It produces a console or log output by displaying the message 'IMSUNLOD ABENDING ...', indicating failure in what appears to be an IMS unload process. It then sets the RETURN-CODE to 16, which signals a specific error condition to the calling JCL or environment. The paragraph concludes with GOBACK to immediately terminate the program execution. No business logic or conditional decisions are implemented within this paragraph. There is no further error handling, as this represents the final escalation point for errors. It does not call any other paragraphs or external programs. The presence of comments suggests this is documentation or spacing for readability. Overall, it ensures a consistent abend behavior across the program.",

        "purpose": "This paragraph acts as a standard exit point primarily used within PERFORM statements to return control to the calling section without altering program flow. It consumes no inputs, data files, or variables, functioning solely as a control transfer mechanism. It produces no outputs, modifications, or side effects such as writes or displays. There is no business logic, conditions, validations, or decisions implemented here. No error handling is performed, as it assumes normal execution path. It executes a single EXIT statement, which transfers control back to the invoker. This paragraph does not call any other paragraphs or programs. It is typically used in nested PERFORM structures to cleanly delineate scope. Given its simplicity, it supports modular code organization in the overall program flow. No specific role in IMS unload is evident beyond general COBOL conventions.",
