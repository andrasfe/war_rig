It first displays the message 'IMSUNLOD ABENDING ...' to the console, indicating that the program is terminating abnormally (4). Then, it sets the RETURN-CODE to 16, signaling to the calling environment that the program ended with an error (6). Finally, it executes a GOBACK statement to terminate the program and return control to the operating system (7). This paragraph does not consume any specific input files or data, nor does it call any other paragraphs. It serves as a centralized error handling routine to ensure a consistent exit strategy.",
