It then moves the transaction ID (WS-CICS-TRANID) and program ID (WS-PGM-AUTH) into the ERROR-LOG-RECORD. The current date and time are also moved into the ERROR-LOG-RECORD. Finally, it writes the ERROR-LOG-RECORD to the 'CSSL' queue using the CICS WRITEQ TD command. If the error is critical (ERR-CRITICAL), it performs the 9990-END-ROUTINE paragraph to terminate the transaction. The paragraph consumes WS-CICS-TRANID, WS-PGM-AUTH, WS-ABS-TIME, WS-CUR-DATE-X6, WS-CUR-TIME-X6, and ERR-CRITICAL. It outputs the ERROR-LOG-RECORD to the 'CSSL' queue.
