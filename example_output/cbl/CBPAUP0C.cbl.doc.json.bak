After processing all details for a summary, it checks if both counts <=0 (bug: duplicate approved check) and performs 6000-DELETE-AUTH-SUMMARY if true. Periodically takes 9000-TAKE-CHECKPOINT if summaries processed exceed frequency. At EOF, final checkpoint and displays total read/deleted stats to console.
