It specifies that the map occupies the entire screen, which is 24 lines by 80 columns. The map is positioned starting at line 1 and column 1. This macro acts as a container for the individual fields defined by the DFHMDF macros. It sets the overall dimensions and starting point for the screen layout. The attributes defined here affect the entire screen's presentation. No specific business logic or error handling is present within this macro definition. It does not call any other paragraphs or programs; it simply defines the screen's structure.",
