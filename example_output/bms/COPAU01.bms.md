## Purpose

This BMS map defines the screen layout for displaying pending authorization details in the CardDemo application. It includes fields for transaction information, card details, authorization specifics, and merchant information, designed for CICS terminal display.

**Business Context**: The screen is used to view details of pending card authorizations, likely as part of a fraud detection or transaction monitoring system.

## Paragraphs/Procedures

### COPAU1A DFHMDI
This DFHMDI macro defines the map's dimensions and placement on the screen. It specifies that the map will start at column 1 and line 1, occupying a size of 24 lines by 80 columns, which represents a standard terminal screen size. This definition acts as a container for all the individual field definitions (DFHMDFs) that make up the screen layout. The SIZE parameter dictates the overall area the map will cover on the display. The COLUMN and LINE parameters determine the map's top-left corner position. The map's attributes, such as the ability to trigger an alarm (ALARM), release the keyboard (FREEKB), use extended attributes (EXTATT=YES), and other control options, are defined in the DFHMSD macro. This paragraph essentially sets the stage for the screen's visual presentation and prepares the CICS environment for displaying the authorization details.

### TRNNAME DFHMDF
