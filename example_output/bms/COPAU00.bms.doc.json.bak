      "purpose": "This DFHMSD macro defines the map set 'COPAU00', which is a collection of related maps. It specifies various attributes for the map set, including control options (ALARM, FREEKB), extended attributes (EXTATT=YES), the programming language (LANG=COBOL), the mode of operation (MODE=INOUT), storage allocation (STORAGE=AUTO), the TIOAPFX option (TIOAPFX=YES), and the type of map (TYPE=&&SYSPARM). The CTRL parameter enables the alarm and allows the keyboard to be freed after input. EXTATT enables extended attributes for color and highlighting. LANG specifies COBOL as the programming language. MODE=INOUT indicates that the map is used for both input and output. STORAGE=AUTO allows CICS to manage the storage for the map. TIOAPFX=YES includes the terminal input/output area prefix. TYPE=&&SYSPARM allows the map type to be specified at compile time. This macro essentially sets the overall environment and characteristics for all the maps defined within this map set, ensuring they adhere to the specified standards and conventions. It does not directly consume or produce data but rather configures the environment for data exchange. No specific business logic or error handling is present within this macro definition itself.",

It specifies the screen's column and line position (COLUMN=1, LINE=1) and its size (SIZE=(24,80)), indicating a full-screen map. The map contains various fields defined using DFHMDF macros. These fields include labels, input fields, and output fields for displaying information such as transaction details, customer information, and account status. The map is designed to present a 'View Authorizations' screen, allowing users to search for accounts, view transaction history, and potentially approve or decline transactions. The input field 'ACCTID' allows the user to enter an account ID to search for. The output fields display customer information such as name, address, account status, and credit/cash limits. The map also includes a table-like structure to display multiple transactions with details like transaction ID, date, time, type, approval status, and amount. The 'SEL' fields (SEL0001, SEL0002, etc.) are unprotected input fields that allow the user to select a transaction for further action. The map does not directly perform any business logic or error handling but defines the visual interface for interacting with the application.",
