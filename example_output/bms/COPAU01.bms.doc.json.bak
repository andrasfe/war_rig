    "summary": "The COPAU01 BMS mapset defines the COPAU1A map for the 'Pending Authorization Details Screen' in a CICS online application. It layouts fields for displaying transaction header (Tran, Date, Prog, Time), authorization details (Card #, Auth Date/Time, Resp, Reason, Code, Amount, POS Entry Mode, Source, MCC Code, Card Exp Date, Auth Type, Tran Id, Match Status, Fraud Status), merchant details (Name, ID, City, State, Zip), error messages, and function keys (F3=Back, F5=Mark/Remove Fraud, F8=Next Auth). The map operates in INOUT mode for both display and user input on unprotected fields.",
