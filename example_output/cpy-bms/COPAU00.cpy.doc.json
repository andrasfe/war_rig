It includes COPAU0AI with fields for lengths, formats, attributes, and input data areas for elements like transaction name, titles, dates, account ID, customer details, addresses, status, phone, counts, limits, balances, selectors for up to 5 transactions (each with ID, date, time, type, approval, status, amount), and error message.
