    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines the symbolic input map COPAU0AI and output map COPAU0AO (via REDEFINES at line 391) for a CICS BMS screen named COPAU00. It structures fields for displaying transaction name, titles, current date/time, program name, customer account ID, name, address lines, account status, phone, approval/decline counts, credit/cash limits and balances, selection flags for up to 5 transactions, and per-transaction details (ID, date, time, type, approval, status, amount), plus an error message field. The structure follows standard BMS conventions with L (length), F/A (flags/attributes), I (input data) for AI, and C/P/H/V/O (change/protect/highlight/visible/output) for AO.",
