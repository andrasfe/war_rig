    "summary": "This COBOL copybook defines the symbolic map data structures COPAU0AI for input and COPAU0AO for output used with the COPAU0A BMS map in CICS online transactions. It structures fields for screen display and data entry including headers like transaction name, titles, date, time, program name; customer account details such as account ID, name, customer ID, addresses, status, phone; financial data like approval/decline counts, credit/cash limits, balances, totals; up to five recent transactions with ID, post date, time, type, approval flag, status, amount; and an error message field. The structure supports typical CICS BMS field attributes and formats for protected, highlighted, visible, and output/input data handling.",
