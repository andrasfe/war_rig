    "summary": "This copybook defines the data structures COPAU1AI (input) and COPAU1AO (output redefines input) for the COPAU1 BMS map in a CICS online application. It structures fields for screen elements including transaction name, titles, current date/time, program name, card number, authorization details (date, time, response, code, amount), POS entry mode, source, MCC, card expiration, auth type, transaction ID, match code, fraud code, merchant details (name, ID, city, state, zip), and error message. Each field follows BMS convention with length (L COMP S9(4)), format flag (F X), attribute (A X), and input data (I), redefined for output with control chars (C/P/H/V) and output data (O).",
