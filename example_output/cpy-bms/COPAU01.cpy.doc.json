These fields are named with suffixes 'C', 'P', 'H', 'V', and 'O' (e.g., TRNNAMEC, TRNNAMEP, TRNNAMEH, TRNNAMEV, TRNNAMEO) to represent control characters, presentation attributes, highlighting, validation, and output values, respectively. The structure includes redefinitions for transaction name, titles, current date and time, card number, authorization details, POS entry mode, authorization source, MCC code, card expiry, authorization type, transaction ID, authorization match, authorization fraud, merchant details, and error message. This structure is used to format the data for display on the screen, setting attributes such as color, highlighting, and validation rules.",
