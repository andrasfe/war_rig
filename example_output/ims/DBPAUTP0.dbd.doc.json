    "summary": "This file contains the IMS Database Definition (DBD) source code for defining database DBPAUTP0 as a HIDAM database with VSAM access method and associated user exits for key, data, and logging. It specifies one dataset group DSG001 with VSAM dataset DDPAUTP0 (4096 bytes, SCAN=3). The database structure includes a root segment PAUTSUM0 (Pending Authorization Summary, 100 bytes, key ACCNTID at position 1, 6 packed bytes, unique sequence, twin backward pointers, logical child PAUTINDX from DBPAUTX0) and a single child segment PAUTDTL1 (Pending Authorization Details, 200 bytes under PAUTSUM0, key PAUT9CTS at position 1, 8 character bytes, unique sequence).",
    "business_context": "Manages hierarchical storage of pending authorization summaries by account ID with associated detail records, likely for financial transaction or payment authorization processing.",
