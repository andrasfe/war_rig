    "summary": "This DBD source file defines the IMS database DBPAUTP0 as a HIDAM database with VSAM access and no password. It specifies one dataset group DSG001 using dataset DDPAUTP0 of size 4096 with SCAN=3. The database contains two segments: root segment PAUTSUM0 (Pending Authorization Summary, 100 bytes) with packed key field ACCNTID (positions 1-6) and a logical child to PAUTINDX in DBPAUTX0, and child segment PAUTDTL1 (Pending Authorization Details, 200 bytes) under PAUTSUM0 with character key PAUT9CTS (positions 1-8).",
    "business_context": "Supports storage and retrieval of pending authorization summary and detail records, likely for financial account or transaction authorization workflows.",
