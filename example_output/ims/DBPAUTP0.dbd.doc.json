It specifies dataset group DSG001 with DDNAME DDPAUTP0 (4096 bytes, SCAN=3) and two segments: root segment PAUTSUM0 (100 bytes) with sequential unique key field ACCNTID (packed, 6 bytes starting at 1) and logical child PAUTINDX to DBPAUTX0, plus child segment PAUTDTL1 (200 bytes under PAUTSUM0) with sequential unique key PAUT9CTS (character, 8 bytes starting at 1). The DBD is generated via DBDGEN.",
