    "summary": "This is an IMS Database Definition (DBD) source file for the HIDAM database DBPAUTP0 using VSAM access. It defines one dataset group DSG001 with VSAM dataset DDPAUTP0 and two segments: root segment PAUTSUM0 (Pending Authorization Summary) with packed key field ACCNTID (6 bytes) and logical child pointer to PAUTINDX in DBPAUTX0, and child segment PAUTDTL1 (Pending Authorization Details, 200 bytes) under PAUTSUM0 with character key PAUT9CTS (8 bytes). The file ends with DBDGEN to generate the database macro for IMS application linkage.",
