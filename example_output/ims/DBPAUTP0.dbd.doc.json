    "summary": "This file contains the source for the IMS Database Definition (DBD) named DBPAUTP0, defining a HIDAM database with VSAM access. It specifies one dataset group, a root segment PAUTSUM0 for Pending Authorization Summary with key field ACCNTID, a logical child to PAUTINDX in DBPAUTX0, and a child segment PAUTDTL1 for Pending Authorization Details with key field PAUT9CTS. The DBDGEN and FINISH statements indicate this is input to the IMS DBDGEN utility to generate the executable DBD module.",
