It defines one dataset group DSG001 using logical dataset DDPAUTP0 of size 4096 with scan value 3. The database has two segments in a hierarchical structure: root segment PAUTSUM0 (Pending Authorization Summary) with key field ACCNTID and child segment PAUTDTL1 (Pending Authorization Details) with key field PAUT9CTS.",
