    "summary": "This file defines an IMS Program Specification Block (PSB) named PSBPAUTB for COBOL-language application programs. It specifies a single database PCB named PAUTBPCB that accesses the DBPAUTP0 database with application-controlled processing (PROCOPT=AP) and a key length of 14 bytes (KEYLEN=14). The PCB senses the root segment PAUTSUM0 (PARENT=0) and its child segment PAUTDTL1 (PARENT=PAUTSUM0).",
