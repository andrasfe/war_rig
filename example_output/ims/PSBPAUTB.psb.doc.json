    "summary": "This file is an IMS Program Specification Block (PSB) definition that generates PSBPAUTB for COBOL programs. It defines a single database PCB named PAUTBPCB for the DBD DBPAUTP0 with PROCOPT=AP and KEYLEN=14, providing access to the root segment PAUTSUM0 and its child segment PAUTDTL1. The PSB is generated in COBOL language with CMPAT=YES for compatibility.",
    "business_context": "Defines IMS hierarchical database access structure for PAUT-related summary (PAUTSUM0) and detail (PAUTDTL1) segments, likely supporting batch DL/I applications for business data such as purchase authorizations or similar transactional records.",
