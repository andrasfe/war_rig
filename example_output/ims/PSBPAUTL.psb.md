## Purpose

This PSB (Program Specification Block) defines the interface for an IMS (Information Management System) application. It specifies the database (DBPAUTP0) and the segments (PAUTSUM0, PAUTDTL1) that the application can access, along with their hierarchical relationships.

## Open Questions

- ? What is the specific purpose of the DBPAUTP0 database and the PAUTSUM0 and PAUTDTL1 segments?
  - Context: The PSB defines the database and segments, but their specific function within the application is unclear.
