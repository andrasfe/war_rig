## Purpose

This PSB (Program Specification Block) defines the database access characteristics for an IMS (Information Management System) application program. It specifies the PCBs (Program Communication Blocks) that the program will use to interact with databases and GSAM (Generalized Sequential Access Method) files, defining segment names, parent-child relationships, and processing options.

## Open Questions

- ? What specific application program uses this PSB?
  - Context: The PSBGEN statement defines the PSB name, but not the application program that uses it.
