    "summary": "This file is the source specification for generating an IMS Program Specification Block (PSB) named PAUTBUNL for a COBOL language program. It defines a single database PCB named PAUTBPCB for accessing the IMS database DBDNAME=DBPAUTP0 with processing option PROCOPT=GOTP (Get Unique Positioned) and key length 14. The PCB senses the root segment PAUTSUM0 (PARENT=0) and its child segment PAUTDTL1 (PARENT=PAUTSUM0), establishing the program's hierarchical access path to the database.",
