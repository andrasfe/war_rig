## Purpose

This PSB (Program Specification Block) defines the database access characteristics for a COBOL program. It specifies the database (DBPAUTP0), the processing options (GOTP), key length, and the segments (PAUTSUM0, PAUTDTL1) that the program will access within that database. The PSB is named PAUTBUNL and is designed to be compatible with COBOL.

## Open Questions
