    "summary": "This PSB defines a single database PCB named PAUTLPCB for accessing the IMS database DBDNAME=DBPAUTP0 with PROCOPT=L (enabling unqualified segment searches) and KEYLEN=14. It specifies two retrievable segments: PAUTSUM0 as the root segment (PARENT=0) and PAUTDTL1 as its child segment under PAUTSUM0. Application programs linked to PSBNAME=PSBPAUTL use this PCB to perform DL/I calls for segment retrieval.",
