    "summary": "The DLIGSAMP.PSB is an IMS Program Specification Block (PSB) source file that defines database access structures for a COBOL DL/I application. It specifies a primary database PCB named PAUTBPCB for the DBPAUTP0 database with read-only GET processing on root segment PAUTSUM0 and child segment PAUTDTL1, plus two GSAM PCBs for sequential locate access to PASFLDBD and PADFLDBD datasets. The PSB is generated for COBOL language use without compatibility mode.",
