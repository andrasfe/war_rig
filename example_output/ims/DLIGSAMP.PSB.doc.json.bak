It specifies the programming language as COBOL and assigns the name DLIGSAMP to the PSB. The CMPAT=NO parameter indicates that compatibility checking with previous PSB versions is disabled. The PSBGEN macro is the final step in defining the PSB, creating a load module that IMS uses to manage database access for the application program. The PSBGEN statement does not directly process data or implement business logic but rather defines the structure and access methods for data used by the application. It consumes the definitions of PCBs and SENSEGs to create the PSB. The PSBGEN statement does not handle errors directly, but errors in the PCB or SENSEG definitions will cause the PSBGEN process to fail. This paragraph does not call any other paragraphs or programs; it is a declarative statement.",
