It defines an indexed VSAM-protected database with a single dataset group DSG001 mapped to DDPAUTX0 and one root segment PAUTINDX of 6 bytes containing a unique packed sequence key field INDXSEQ. The PAUTINDX segment establishes a logical child (LCHILD) relationship to the PAUTSUM0 segment in the DBPAUTP0 database via the ACCNTID index.",
