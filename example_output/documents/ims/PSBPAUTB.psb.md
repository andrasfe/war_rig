## Purpose

This file defines a Program Specification Block (PSB) named PSBPAUTB for an IMS database application. It specifies the database (DBPAUTP0), processing options (AP), key length (14), and defines two segments (PAUTSUM0 and PAUTDTL1) with their parent-child relationship. The PSB is configured for COBOL language compatibility.

## Open Questions

- ? What is the specific purpose of the DBPAUTP0 database and the PAUTSUM0 and PAUTDTL1 segments within the broader application context?
  - Context: The PSB definition provides the structure but lacks context on how these database elements are used.
