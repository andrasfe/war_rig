It starts by declaring the DBD name, access method (INDEX, VSAM, PROT), and password protection status (NO) on line 18. The VERSION parameter is also present but has no specified value. The definition proceeds to define a single dataset group (DSG001) on line 23, specifying the DD name (DDPAUTX0) and size (4096). Following this, the segment PAUTINDX is defined on line 27, specifying its name, parent (0 indicating root segment), byte size (6), and frequency. The segment contains a single field, INDXSEQ, defined as a packed decimal (TYPE=P) sequence field, starting at position 1 with a length of 6 bytes. Finally, a logical child relationship is defined on line 30, linking PAUTINDX to PAUTSUM0 in database DBPAUTP0, using ACCNTID as the index.",
