However, data_flow.reads_from lists them as 'fields_used' for each file with citations to READ statements (e.g., 141). Does the documentation accurately reflect the data flow?",

      "question": "Line 128 performs GO TO 9999-GOBACK for unrecognized LK-M03B-DD without moving any file status to LK-M03B-RC. For valid DD but unrecognized operation, the code falls through to the *-EXIT paragraph (e.g., lines 151-152 for TRNX) and moves the (unchanged/initial) working-storage status to LK-M03B-RC. Does the purpose summary and BR006 accurately distinguish these cases regarding RC setting and return behavior?",
