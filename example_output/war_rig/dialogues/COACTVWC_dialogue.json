      "question": "In business_rules BR003, lines 462 and 465 are cited, but line 462 sets WS-PROMPT-FOR-INPUT only for EIBCALEN=0, while line 465 handles display of ACCTSIDO for blank filter without setting the prompt flag. For re-entry with blank input, line 658 sets WS-PROMPT-FOR-ACCT (an error message 'Account number not provided') instead of the prompt. Does this accurately reflect 'prompt for account ID' on blank filter?",
