It orchestrates the overall execution environment for deleting expired authorizations via IMS. It consumes no direct data inputs but sets the context for DD allocations in subordinate steps. It produces job logs, SMF records, and notifications as standard JCL outputs. No business logic or conditions are implemented at the JOB level; execution proceeds unconditionally to defined steps if submitted successfully. Error handling is implicit via JCL (e.g., job failure if no steps complete). It contains or 'calls' the STEP01 processing step. No validations or external program calls occur here. The job relies on STEP01 for all processing.",

It produces outputs to multiple SYSOUT datasets including SYSOUX, SYSOUT, SYSABOUT, ABENDAID, SYSPRINT, SYSUDUMP, and IMSERR for logs, prints, and dumps. Business logic is delegated to CBPAUP0C; no decisions in JCL itself. Error handling includes DUMMY for IEFRDER/IMSLOGR, ABENDAID for abend aid, and SYSUDUMP for diagnostics on failures. It statically executes DFSRRC00 and dynamically loads CBPAUP0C via PARM. No subordinate paragraphs exist as this is JCL. File statuses are handled by IMS via dumps/prints. Control flow is linear: EXEC followed by DD definitions.",
