It includes elementary fields for card number (PIC X(16)), transaction ID (PIC X(15)), authorization ID code (PIC X(06)), authorization response code (PIC X(02)), response reason (PIC X(04)), and approved amount (PIC +9(10).99). The fields share a 'PA-RL-' prefix, logically grouping them for use in payment authorization processing.
