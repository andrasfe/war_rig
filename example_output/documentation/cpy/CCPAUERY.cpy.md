It includes fields for timestamp (ERR-DATE, ERR-TIME), application and program identifiers (ERR-APPLICATION, ERR-PROGRAM), error location (ERR-LOCATION), severity level (ERR-LEVEL with 88-level condition names for LOG, INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL), subsystem type (ERR-SUBSYSTEM with 88-levels for APP, CICS, IMS, DB2, MQ, FILE), error codes (ERR-CODE-1, ERR-CODE-2), message text (ERR-MESSAGE), and an event key (ERR-EVENT-KEY).
