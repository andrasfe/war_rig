## Purpose

This copybook defines the data structure PAUTBPCB (line 17), which is the Program Communication Block (PCB) for the PAUT IMS database. It includes fields for database name (PAUT-DBDNAME, line 18), current segment level (PAUT-SEG-LEVEL, line 19), PCB status code (PAUT-PCB-STATUS, line 20), processing options (PAUT-PCB-PROCOPT, line 21), segment name (PAUT-SEG-NAME, line 23), key feedback name offset (PAUT-KEYFB-NAME, line 24), number of sensitive segments (PAUT-NUM-SENSEGS, line 25), and a 255-byte key feedback buffer (PAUT-KEYFB, line 26). This structure is used by IMS DL/I programs to manage database calls and retrieve status and positioning information.

**Business Context:** IMS DL/I hierarchical database navigation and access for the PAUT database
**Program Type:** UTILITY
**Citations:** Lines 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26
