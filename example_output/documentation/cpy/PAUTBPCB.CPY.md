## Purpose

This copybook defines the structure PAUTBPCB, which appears to be related to IMS PCB (Program Communication Block) information. It contains fields for DBD name, segment level, PCB status, processing options, segment name, key feedback name, number of sensitive segments, and key feedback data. The copybook is likely used to access and manipulate PCB data within a COBOL program interacting with an IMS database.
