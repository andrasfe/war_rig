COPAU0AI defines the input fields with their lengths, attributes, and input/output fields, while COPAU0AO redefines COPAU0AI to define the output fields with their corresponding attributes. The fields include transaction name, titles, current date and time, account ID, customer name, customer ID, address, account status, phone number, approval/decline counts, credit/cash limits and balances, transaction details (ID, date, time, type, approval status, amount), and error messages. The fields are designed to be used with BMS macros to create the screen layout for the CICS application. The copybook does not perform any business logic or error handling itself; it only defines the structure and format of the data displayed on the screen.",
