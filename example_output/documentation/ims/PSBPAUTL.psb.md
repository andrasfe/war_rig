## Purpose

This PSB (Program Specification Block) defines the database access characteristics for an IMS (Information Management System) application. It specifies the database (DBPAUTP0), the processing options, key length, and the segments (PAUTSUM0, PAUTDTL1) that the application is allowed to access. The PSB is generated using the ASSEM (Assembler) language.

## Open Questions

- ? What specific application uses this PSB?
  - Context: The code only defines the PSB structure, not its usage.
