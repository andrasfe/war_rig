    "summary": "This file defines an IMS Program Specification Block (PSB) named PAUTBUNL for a COBOL language program. It specifies a single PCB named PAUTBPCB providing access to the IMS database DBDNAME=DBPAUTP0 with PROCOPT=GOTP and KEYLEN=14. The PCB defines two sensegments: PAUTSUM0 as the root segment (PARENT=0) and PAUTDTL1 as a child segment under PAUTSUM0.",
