It declares PAUTINDX as a root segment (PARENT=0) with a total length of 6 bytes and expected frequency of 100000. It consumes no runtime inputs but structurally references the dataset from DSG001 for storage. It defines the key field INDXSEQ as a 6-byte packed unique sequential field starting at position 1, which serves as the primary ordering and uniqueness mechanism. It establishes a logical child pointer to PAUTSUM0 in another database DBPAUTP0 using the ACCNTID index for hierarchical navigation. No explicit business decisions or validations are coded here as this is a static definition. Error handling is not applicable in the DBD source itself. It culminates in DBDGEN to generate the database description and FINISH to end the definition. This segment definition enables DL/I application programs to insert, retrieve, and traverse PAUTINDX records and their logical children.",
