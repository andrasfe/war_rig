    "summary": "This file is the source for generating the IMS Program Specification Block (PSB) named DLIGSAMP for use in a COBOL program. It defines a database PCB (PAUTBPCB) for the hierarchical IMS database DBPAUTP0 with PROCOPT=GOTP and KEYLEN=14, providing access to root segment PAUTSUM0 (PARENT=0) and child segment PAUTDTL1 (PARENT=PAUTSUM0). It also defines two GSAM PCBs for databases PASFLDBD and PADFLDBD, both with PROCOPT=LS.",
