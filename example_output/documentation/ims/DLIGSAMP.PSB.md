# DLIGSAMP

**File:** ims/DLIGSAMP.PSB
**Type:** OTHER
**Status:** In Progress
**Iterations:** 1
**Analyzed:** 2026-01-30 19:46:07.377835

## Purpose

This file is the source for generating the IMS Program Specification Block (PSB) named DLIGSAMP for use in a COBOL program. It defines a database PCB (PAUTBPCB) for the hierarchical IMS database DBPAUTP0 with PROCOPT=GOTP and KEYLEN=14, providing access to root segment PAUTSUM0 (PARENT=0) and child segment PAUTDTL1 (PARENT=PAUTSUM0). It also defines two GSAM PCBs for databases PASFLDBD and PADFLDBD, both with PROCOPT=LS.
**Program Type:** UTILITY
**Citations:** Lines 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23

## Inputs

### DBPAUTP0
- **Type:** IMS_SEGMENT
- **Description:** Hierarchical IMS database accessed via PCB PAUTBPCB with segments PAUTSUM0 (root) and PAUTDTL1
- **Lines:** 18, 19, 20

### PASFLDBD
- **Type:** IMS_SEGMENT
- **Description:** GSAM IMS database accessed via unnamed PCB
- **Lines:** 21

### PADFLDBD
- **Type:** IMS_SEGMENT
- **Description:** GSAM IMS database accessed via unnamed PCB
- **Lines:** 22

## Open Questions

- **What is the business purpose of the DBPAUTP0 database and its segments PAUTSUM0 and PAUTDTL1?**
  - Context: PSB defines structure and access but provides no descriptive comments on data content or business use
  - Suggestion: Review associated DBD source, COBOL program source using this PSB, or application documentation
- **What do the GSAM databases PASFLDBD and PADFLDBD contain?**
  - Context: Names suggest sequential files (possibly summary/detail logs), but no details in PSB source
  - Suggestion: Examine DBD definitions or programs using these PCBs
- **What are the exact meanings of PROCOPT=GOTP for the DB PCB and PROCOPT=LS for GSAM PCBs?**
  - Context: Standard IMS PROCOPT documented externally; GOTP implies GET with positioning/optimization, LS implies sequential load/browse, but specifics depend on IMS version
  - Suggestion: Consult IMS manuals for PROCOPT options applicable to these DBD types
