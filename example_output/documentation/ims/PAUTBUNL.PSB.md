# PAUTBUNL

**File:** ims/PAUTBUNL.PSB
**Type:** OTHER
**Status:** In Progress
**Iterations:** 1
**Analyzed:** 2026-01-30 19:42:22.408833

## Purpose

This file defines an IMS Program Specification Block (PSB) named PAUTBUNL for a COBOL language program. It specifies a single PCB named PAUTBPCB providing access to the IMS database DBDNAME=DBPAUTP0 with PROCOPT=GOTP and KEYLEN=14. The PCB defines two sensegments: PAUTSUM0 as the root segment (PARENT=0) and PAUTDTL1 as a child segment under PAUTSUM0.
**Program Type:** BATCH
**Citations:** Lines 18, 19, 20, 21

## Inputs

### DBPAUTP0
- **Type:** IMS_SEGMENT
- **Description:** IMS database referenced by the PCB, accessible via segments PAUTSUM0 (root) and PAUTDTL1 (child)
- **Lines:** 18, 19, 20

## Open Questions

- **What is the business purpose of the DBPAUTP0 database and its segments PAUTSUM0/PAUTDTL1?**
  - Context: No descriptive comments or names indicate business meaning beyond technical IMS structure
  - Suggestion: Review associated DBD definitions or calling COBOL programs for context
- **Is this PSB used in batch DL/I, MPP, BMP, or IFP region?**
  - Context: PROCOPT=GOTP suggests possible TP usage, but no explicit region type specified
  - Suggestion: Check JCL or IMS region definitions for the PAUTBUNL program
