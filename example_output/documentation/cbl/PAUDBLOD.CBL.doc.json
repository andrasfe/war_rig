      "summary": null,
      "purpose": "This paragraph handles program termination due to an error condition. It displays a message indicating that the IMS load is abending. It then sets the RETURN-CODE to 16, which signals an abnormal termination to the operating system or calling program. Finally, it terminates the program using the GOBACK statement. This paragraph serves as a central error handling routine, ensuring a consistent termination process when errors are encountered during program execution. The setting of the RETURN-CODE allows for external monitoring of program success or failure.",
