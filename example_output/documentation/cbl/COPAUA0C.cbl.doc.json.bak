It produces incremented WS-MSG-PROCESSED counter, commits transactions via CICS SYNCPOINT, and sets IMS-PSB-NOT-SCHD flag after each iteration. Business logic centers on the UNTIL loop condition, sequential calls to extract and process each message, and a check against WS-REQSTS-PROCESS-LIMIT to terminate early if exceeded. Error handling is delegated to called paragraphs like 2100, 5000, and 3100, with no explicit handling here; syncpoint ensures atomicity per message. It calls 2100-EXTRACT-REQUEST-MSG THRU 2100-EXIT to parse incoming messages, 5000-PROCESS-AUTH THRU 5000-EXIT for authorization logic, and conditionally 3100-READ-REQUEST-MQ THRU 3100-EXIT to fetch the next message.",

It first moves XREF-CUST-ID to WS-CARD-RID-CUST-ID and prepares the RIDFLD key. The CICS READ populates the entire CUSTOMER-RECORD structure if successful. It then evaluates the WS-RESP-CD response: on NORMAL, sets FOUND-CUST-IN-MSTR to TRUE indicating successful retrieval; on NOTFND, sets NFOUND-CUST-IN-MSTR to TRUE, populates warning-level error details (A003, 'CUST NOT FOUND IN XREF') with the cust ID as event key, and performs 9500-LOG-ERROR for auditing without halting. For any other response code, it treats as critical CICS error (C003), formats RESP and RESP2 codes into display fields and error structure, sets error flags, adds message 'FAILED TO READ CUST FILE', and performs 9500-LOG-ERROR. No file outputs are produced; instead, it updates flags and error logging structures for use by caller. This supports business validation in authorization flows by confirming customer existence before further processing. Error handling favors logging over abend to allow graceful degradation. It is likely called iteratively from a main processing loop handling transaction cards.",

It consumes working storage variables such as WS-ABS-TIME (populated externally or by prior ASKTIME), WS-CICS-TRANID, WS-PGM-AUTH, and ERR-CRITICAL to build a complete error record. The process starts by invoking CICS ASKTIME with NOHANDLE to fetch the current absolute time into WS-ABS-TIME without error checking. It then uses CICS FORMATTIME with NOHANDLE to convert WS-ABS-TIME into formatted YYMMDD date in WS-CUR-DATE-X6 and time in WS-CUR-TIME-X6. These values, along with transaction ID and program authority, are moved into corresponding fields of the ERROR-LOG-RECORD structure (ERR-APPLICATION, ERR-PROGRAM, ERR-DATE, ERR-TIME). The fully populated ERROR-LOG-RECORD is then written to the CICS transient data queue 'CSSL' via WRITEQ with NOHANDLE, ensuring log persistence even if write fails. After logging, it evaluates the business rule by checking if ERR-CRITICAL is true; if so, it performs 9990-END-ROUTINE to initiate program termination and prevent further processing. No explicit validation or error handling is performed on the CICS commands due to NOHANDLE clauses, implying silent failure tolerance. The outputs are the queue entry for audit trails and potential branch to termination. This paragraph does not call external programs but orchestrates flow to cleanup on critical issues.",
