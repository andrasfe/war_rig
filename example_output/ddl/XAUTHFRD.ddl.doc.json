      "purpose": "This DDL script creates a unique index named XAUTHFRD on the AUTHFRDS table within the CARDDEMO schema. The primary purpose of this index is to enforce uniqueness based on the combination of CARD_NUM and AUTH_TS columns, optimizing query performance for searches involving these fields. The index is defined to sort CARD_NUM in ascending order and AUTH_TS in descending order, which can be beneficial for queries that retrieve the most recent authorizations for a given card number. The 'COPY YES' clause ensures that the index is included in database backups and recovery processes, maintaining data integrity and availability. The script does not consume any external input files or parameters directly, but relies on the existing table structure of CARDDEMO.AUTHFRDS. It outputs a new index object within the CARDDEMO schema. No specific error handling is implemented within this DDL script, as errors during index creation would typically be handled by the database management system.",
