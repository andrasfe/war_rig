      "answer": "**AUTHFRDS Table Purpose:**  \nThe `CARDDEMO.AUTHFRDS` table is a DB2 table specifically for **fraud tracking and reporting** on card authorization messages/transactions. It stores detailed authorization records (e.g., `CARD_NUM`, `AUTH_TS`, `AUTH_TYPE`, `TRANSACTION_AMT`, merchant details, response codes) along with fraud-specific fields like `AUTH_FRAUD` (flag indicating fraud status), `FRAUD_RPT_DATE` (date fraud was reported), `ACCT_ID`, and `CUST_ID`.  \n\nThis is confirmed by:  \n- **README.md** (lines 271, 113): Explicitly describes it as \"DB2 table for fraud tracking\".  \n- **COPAUS2C.cbl** (lines 2-5, 142-198, 223-244): CICS COBOL program \"Mark Authorization Message Fraud\". Performs upsert logic—**INSERT** full auth record with fraud flag into `AUTHFRDS` (populating from input fraud auth record via `CIPAUDTY` copybook); on duplicate key error (SQLCODE -803), **UPDATE** sets `AUTH_FRAUD` and `FRAUD_RPT_DATE`. Input includes action ('F' report fraud, 'R' remove), account/customer IDs.  \n- Table DDL (`ddl/AUTHFRDS.ddl`): Primary key `(CARD_NUM, AUTH_TS)` enforces uniqueness per card/timestamp.  \n\n**XAUTHFRD Index Purpose:**  \nUnique index `CARDDEMO.XAUTHFRD` on `(CARD_NUM ASC, AUTH_TS DESC)` with `COPY YES` (allows index rebuild during table reorganization). Supports:  \n- **Efficient lookups** by card number for the *most recent* authorization (DESC timestamp).  \n- **Upsert enforcement** (unique constraint catches duplicates for UPDATE).  \n- **Fraud queries**: Quick retrieval of latest fraud-flagged auths per card for reporting/analysis.  \n\nSources: `ddl/XAUTHFRD.ddl`, `ddl/AUTHFRDS.ddl`, `cbl/COPAUS2C.cbl` (full file read), `README.md`, `dcl/AUTHFRDS.dcl`. No other code references found, confirming isolated fraud subsystem role.",
