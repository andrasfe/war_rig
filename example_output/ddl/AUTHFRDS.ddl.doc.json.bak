      "purpose": "This paragraph constitutes the entire DDL script for creating the AUTHFRDS table in the CARDDEMO schema, serving as the foundational schema definition for storing detailed authorization records used in fraud analysis for card transactions. It consumes no inputs, as it is a declarative CREATE TABLE statement with no data reads or parameters. The output is the table structure itself, defined across lines 1-28 with 27 columns including primary keys CARD_NUM (CHAR(16) NOT NULL at line 2) and AUTH_TS (TIMESTAMP NOT NULL at line 3), which ensure unique identification of each auth event. Key data elements include transaction details like TRANSACTION_AMT (DECIMAL(12,2) at line 12), APPROVED_AMT (line 13), response codes such as AUTH_RESP_CODE (CHAR(2) at line 9), merchant info like MERCHANT_ID (CHAR(15) at line 17), MERCHANT_NAME (VARCHAR(22) at line 18), and fraud indicators including AUTH_FRAUD (CHAR(1) at line 24), MATCH_STATUS (line 23), and FRAUD_RPT_DATE (DATE at line 25). No business logic or conditional decisions are implemented, as this is purely a structural definition without processing flows. There is no error handling, validation, or exceptional condition management within the script. No other paragraphs, subroutines, or external programs are called or referenced. The table links to accounts via ACCT_ID (DECIMAL(11) at line 26) and customers via CUST_ID (DECIMAL(9) at line 27), supporting downstream queries and inserts by application programs for fraud pattern detection.",
