      "purpose": "This DDL script defines the CARDDEMO.AUTHFRDS table schema. The table is designed to store detailed information about card authorization requests and potential fraud indicators. The script begins by creating the table with specific column definitions, including data types, lengths, and nullability constraints. Key fields include CARD_NUM and AUTH_TS, which together form the primary key, ensuring uniqueness of authorization records. Other columns capture transaction details such as amounts, merchant information, and authorization response codes. The table also includes fields to flag potential fraud (AUTH_FRAUD) and record the date when fraud was reported (FRAUD_RPT_DATE). The table does not directly consume inputs or produce outputs in the traditional sense, but it defines the structure for data storage and retrieval by other applications. No explicit error handling is defined within the DDL itself, as error handling would be managed by the database system during table creation or data manipulation. No other paragraphs or programs are called within this DDL script; it solely focuses on defining the table structure.",
