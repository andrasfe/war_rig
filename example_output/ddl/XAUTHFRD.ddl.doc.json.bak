It consumes the existing table CARDDEMO.AUTHFRDS as input, referencing it explicitly on line 2 and its columns CARD_NUM and AUTH_TS on line 3. It produces the index as output, which is declared on line 1 and configured with the COPY YES option on line 4. The business logic enforces data integrity by requiring uniqueness on the composite key CARD_NUM (ascending) and AUTH_TS (descending), optimizing for queries retrieving the latest authorization per card. There is no conditional branching, validation, or error handling explicitly coded in the DDL statement, as DDL execution errors are handled by the DB2 engine. No subordinate paragraphs or external programs are called, as this is a standalone CREATE INDEX statement. The descending order on AUTH_TS ensures the most recent records appear first in index scans.",
