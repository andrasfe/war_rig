No outputs are produced beyond potential SYSOUT messages to SYSPRINT, SYSOUT, and SYSDUMP. There is no business logic or conditional decision-making; it unconditionally attempts deletion. Error handling is implicit via JCL: if files do not exist, the step abends with JCL error, preventing STEP01 from running. It defines dummy DDs for standard output. This step is the entry point of the job and passes control to STEP01 upon success. No other paragraphs or programs are called.",

It consumes IMS control files from STEPLIB (SDFSRESL libraries and loadlib), DFSRESLB, IMS (PSBLIB/DBDLIB), DDPAUTP0 (PAUTHDB PSB), DDPAUTX0 (PAUTHDBX DBDX), and DFSVSAMP (DFSVSMDB). The utility reads all root and child segments from PAUTDB IMS database. It produces two outputs: OUTFIL1 for root segments (new cataloged DSN with specified DCB/SPACE) and OUTFIL2 for child segments. Business logic is encapsulated in the utility: separates root/child based on DBD definition, formats as FB sequential. Validation and error handling are handled by IMS utility, with dumps to SYSUDUMP, IMSERR, IMSLOGR (DUMMY), and SYSPRINT. Dummy DDs like IEFRDER prevent unnecessary I/O. Called unconditionally after STEP0, it completes the job upon success. No subordinate paragraphs; relies on utility internals.",
