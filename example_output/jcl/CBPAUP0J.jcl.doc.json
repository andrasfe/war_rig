      "purpose": "STEP01 is the only execution step in this JCL job and serves as the primary orchestrator for running the IMS batch deletion process. It consumes input from multiple DD datasets including STEPLIB for load modules (lines 26-27), DFSRESLB (28), PROCLIB (29), DFSSEL (31), IMS PSB/DBDLIB (33-34), and inline SYSIN control data '00,00001,00001,Y' (36-37) which provides parameters for IMS database access by CBPAUP0C. It produces outputs to SYSOUT-class datasets such as SYSOUX (39), SYSOUT (40), SYSABOUT (41), ABENDAID (42), SYSPRINT (45), SYSUDUMP (46), and IMSERR (47) for capturing program output, logs, dumps, and errors. Business logic is not implemented directly in JCL but delegated via EXEC PGM=DFSRRC00 with PARM='BMP,CBPAUP0C,PSBPAUTB' (24-25) to execute the authorization deletion. No conditional decisions are made in the JCL; processing flow is linear based on program success. Error handling is provided implicitly through ABENDAID and SYSUDUMP DDs to capture abend details if DFSRRC00 or CBPAUP0C fails. Dummy DDs IEFRDER (43) and IMSLOGR (44) satisfy program I/O requirements without files. This step controls the overall job flow for the 'DELETE EXPIRED AUTHORIZATIONS' purpose (21). It statically calls DFSRRC00, which dynamically invokes CBPAUP0C for the core IMS processing.",

Defaults to 5 if spaces/0/low-values.\n- **P-CHKP-DIS-FREQ ('00001')**: In `9000-TAKE-CHECKPOINT` (lines 359-364), displays checkpoint success msg every 1st CHKP (`WS-NO-CHKP >= '00001'`).

No specific IMS database name or DBD name is mentioned in CBPAUP0C.cbl, its preprocessor includes (CIPAUSMY, CIPAUDTY), or the JCL CBPAUP0J.jcl.

The DBD is defined at the PSB/PCB level (not in application source code), likely named something like PAUTDBD based on naming conventions, but no confirmation found.\n\n**Segments Accessed:**\n- **PAUTSUM0** (parent/summary segment): Accessed via `GN` (Get Next sequential) in 2000-FIND-NEXT-AUTH-SUMMARY (lines ~223-226) and `DLET` (Delete) in 6000-DELETE-AUTH-SUMMARY (lines ~335-338).\n- **PAUTDTL1** (child/details segment): Accessed via `GNP` (Get Next Predictive/Parent-qualified) in 3000-FIND-NEXT-AUTH-DTL (lines ~255-258) and `DLET` (Delete) in 5000-DELETE-AUTH-DTL (lines ~310-313).\n\n**What was checked:**\n- `citadel_analyze_file` on cbl/CBPAUP0C.cbl: Confirmed structure, paragraphs (e.g., MAIN-PARA performs read/delete logic), calls (GN/GNP/DLET), and includes (CIPAUSMY, CIPAUDTY).\n- `search_code` for 'CBPAUP0C', 'PAUTB', 'PCB|DBD|GU|GN|ISRT|DLET|GHU|GHN', 'PAUT': Located PSB='PSBPAUTB', PCB=+2, all DL/I calls and segments.\n- `citadel_get_includes` on cbl/CBPAUP0C.cbl: Only CIPAUSMY/CIPAUDTY (likely segment I/O area definitions; no DBD found).\n- No skills via `search_skills` for 'CBPAUP0C'/'PAUTB'.\n- No DBD/database strings in code; typical for IMS apps (resolved via PSB compile).\n\nThe program deletes expired pending authorizations by sequentially reading summaries (PAUTSUM0), qualifying details (PAUTDTL1), checking expiration dates, and deleting both (with checkpoints).
