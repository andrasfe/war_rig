{"id":"war_rig-09jq","title":"Integrate structural pre-check into Challenger validation pipeline","description":"## Context\n\nTickets war_rig-ylbu and war_rig-v8pf provide the building blocks: Citadel context loading and structural comparison logic. This ticket wires them into the ChallengerWorker's existing validation flow so that the structural pre-check runs BEFORE the LLM-based ChallengerAgent.ainvoke() call, and its results merge with the LLM output.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Modify _process_ticket() in ChallengerWorker (war_rig/workers/challenger_pool.py, line 449). After _load_documentation_state() succeeds (line 498) and before calling _validate_documentation() (line 513), add a structural pre-check step:\n   - Resolve the source file path from state or ticket metadata (state has file_name, metadata has file_path)\n   - Call _get_citadel_context(file_path) to load structural facts\n   - If citadel_context is not None, call _run_structural_precheck(citadel_context, state[\"template\"], ticket.file_name)\n   - Store the structural issues list for later merging\n\n2. Modify _validate_documentation() (line 777) to accept an optional parameter structural_issues: list[ChallengerQuestion] = None. Inside the method:\n   - After ChallengerAgent.ainvoke() returns (line 824), merge structural_issues into the output:\n     - Convert structural ChallengerQuestion objects to the same dict format used by blocking_questions (lines 835-846): {question_id, section, question_type, question, severity, evidence}\n     - Prepend structural issues to the blocking_questions list (structural issues come first)\n   - Deduplicate: if the LLM also raised a question about the same section + same paragraph name, prefer the structural issue (it has exact evidence from Citadel)\n\n3. Add optional LLM-skip optimization: If structural pre-check alone finds >= 3 BLOCKING issues, skip the LLM call entirely and return a ValidationResult with is_valid=False and those blocking questions. Log a message explaining the skip (cost saving). This should be controlled by a boolean attribute (e.g., self.config or a constant SKIP_LLM_ON_STRUCTURAL_BLOCKING = True).\n\n4. Ensure the pre-check does NOT run for discovery tickets (_process_discovery_validation at line 915 -- this path returns early before _validate_documentation is called, so no change needed there).\n\n5. Update ValidationResult (line 91-107) if needed -- may want to add a field like structural_issues_count: int = 0 for observability.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Structural pre-check runs before LLM call in the validation pipeline\n- Structural issues are prepended to LLM blocking questions\n- When structural pre-check finds >= 3 BLOCKING issues, LLM call is skipped (configurable)\n- When structural pre-check returns empty list, LLM validation proceeds unchanged (backwards compatible)\n- Discovery ticket validation is unaffected\n- Logging shows when structural pre-check ran, how many issues found, whether LLM was skipped\n- The was_sampled filter logic (lines 852-883) still applies to LLM-generated questions only (not structural ones)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- war_rig/workers/challenger_pool.py:\n  - _process_ticket() method (~line 449)\n  - _validate_documentation() method (~line 777)\n  - ValidationResult dataclass (~line 91) -- optional field addition\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: war_rig-ylbu (Citadel context loading)\n- Depends on: war_rig-v8pf (Structural comparison logic)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T15:16:50.113548739-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-01-27T15:24:08.088624718-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T15:24:08.088624718-07:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

{"id":"war_rig-7831","title":"Fix get_callers() performance: use dependency graph instead of per-paragraph discovery","description":"## Problem\n\n`get_callers()` is called per-paragraph in a loop within `_enrich_paragraphs_with_citadel()` (scribe_pool.py:548). Each call to `get_callers()` runs a full `FileDiscovery.discover()` (citadel/src/citadel/sdk.py:1052-1053), which scans the entire source directory.\n\nThis causes N directory scans for N paragraphs - massive overhead that significantly slows down documentation generation for codebases with many paragraphs.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `get_callers()` method in Citadel SDK (sdk.py:1040-1069) performs:\n1. Directory discovery to find all source files\n2. Analysis of each file to find caller references\n\nThis is done from scratch on every call, even though War Rig already generates a complete dependency graph upfront.\n\n## Solution\n\nWar Rig already generates a `dependency_graph.json` upfront via Citadel during `_generate_citadel_graph()` (ticket_engine.py:2130-2147). This graph contains all call relationships (who calls whom) and is already passed to ScribeWorkerPool via `dependency_graph_path`.\n\nThe fix should:\n1. Load the dependency graph once when ScribeWorkerPool initializes (it's already passed via constructor)\n2. Build a callers lookup dict from the graph edges during initialization\n3. Replace the per-paragraph `get_callers()` call at scribe_pool.py:548 with a simple dict lookup\n\n## Key Locations\n\n- `war_rig/workers/scribe_pool.py:548` - The problematic `get_callers()` call inside `_enrich_paragraphs_with_citadel()`\n- `war_rig/orchestration/ticket_engine.py:2130-2147` - `_generate_citadel_graph()` creates the dependency graph\n- `war_rig/orchestration/ticket_engine.py:575-580` - dependency_graph_path is already passed to ScribeWorkerPool\n- `citadel/src/citadel/sdk.py:1040-1070` - Current slow `get_callers()` implementation for reference\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Dependency graph is loaded once when ScribeWorkerPool initializes\n- [ ] A callers lookup dict is built from graph edges (keyed by target file+function)\n- [ ] The `get_callers()` call in `_enrich_paragraphs_with_citadel()` is replaced with dict lookup\n- [ ] Existing tests pass\n- [ ] Add test verifying callers lookup works correctly from cached graph","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-28T11:48:04.247512399-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-01-28T11:54:51.26537246-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-28T11:54:51.265375115-07:00"}
{"id":"war_rig-7gsl","title":"Root cause analysis: Why Scribe sends 35K tokens without truncation","description":"## Problem\n\nThe Scribe agent is sending ~35K tokens when it should be limiting prompts to ~15K tokens (the configured `scribe_max_prompt_tokens` default).\n\n## Root Cause Hypothesis (Based on Investigation)\n\n**The token limiting logic was never implemented or was removed.**\n\nEvidence from code analysis:\n\n### 1. Config Defines Limits but They're Unused\n\n```python\n# In config.py (lines 73-76, 191-194)\nclass ScribeConfig(ModelConfig):\n    max_prompt_tokens: int = Field(\n        default=15000,\n        description=\"Maximum approximate tokens for the prompt (will truncate content to fit)\",\n    )\n```\n\nThe description says 'will truncate content to fit' but **NO CODE DOES THIS**.\n\n### 2. ScribeAgent Never Reads max_prompt_tokens\n\nIn `scribe.py`, the ScribeAgent:\n- Takes a `ScribeConfig` in __init__ but only uses `config.model` and `config.temperature`\n- `_build_user_prompt()` method builds the full prompt without any truncation\n- Simply concatenates: file info + preprocessor JSON + full source code + copybooks + previous template + questions\n\n### 3. Source Code Is Added Without Any Size Check\n\n```python\n# In scribe.py lines 352-360\n# Source code\nparts.append(\"## Source Code\")\nparts.append(\"\\`\\`\\`\")\nlines = input_data.source_code.split(\"\\n\")\nfor i, line in enumerate(lines, start=1):\n    parts.append(f\"{i:5d} | {line}\")  # ALL lines, no limit\\!\nparts.append(\"\\`\\`\\`\")\n```\n\n### 4. Chunking Logic Was Removed\n\nGit commit `ea26209` (Jan 19, 2026) removed the Atlas chunking framework:\n- Deleted war_rig/chunking/ directory\n- Deleted routing logic that would have split large files\n- The commit message says 'Atlas was a planned but never implemented chunking orchestration system'\n\n## Confirmed Root Cause\n\n**The token limiting was designed but never implemented. The config field `scribe_max_prompt_tokens` is a placeholder that is completely unused by the actual code.**\n\nThe chunking framework that would have handled large files was removed because it was 'non-functional dead code'.\n\n## Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier\n\n- Small COBOL files (most are under 2000 lines) work fine\n- The ~35K token limit is only hit by large programs\n- No automated tests verify token limits are respected\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- war_rig-dowu: Investigation ticket (parent)\n- war_rig-ekkk: Epic for Atlas chunking embedding (still open but work was removed)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-21T09:37:59.782357158-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-01-29T19:35:33.087702-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T19:35:33.087702-07:00","close_reason":"Closed by user","labels":["bug","root-cause","scribe","token-limit"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"war_rig-7gsl","depends_on_id":"war_rig-dowu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-21T09:37:59.784958787-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe"}]}

This enables readers to click from the documentation directly to the extracted source code.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. Standalone patcher function (for existing .md files)\n\nAdd to `war_rig/io/paragraph_splitter.py`:\n\n#### `patch_markdown_links(md_path: Path, split_dir: Path, relative_link: bool = True) -> bool`\n- Read the existing `.cbl.md` file\n- Find all paragraph headings matching the pattern `### {paragraph_name}` under the `## Key Paragraphs` or `## Paragraphs/Procedures` section\n- Also handle dead-code headings: `### ~~{paragraph_name}~~ (Dead Code)`\n- For each heading, check if a matching file exists in `split_dir` (using `sanitize_filename()`)\n- If the split file exists, append a source link after the heading line:\n  ```markdown\n  ### MAIN-PARA\n  > [Source: MAIN-PARA.cbl](PROG.cbl.d/MAIN-PARA.cbl)\n  ```\n  For dead code:\n  ```markdown\n  ### ~~9999-EXIT~~ (Dead Code)\n  > [Source: 9999-EXIT.cbl](PROG.cbl.d/9999-EXIT.cbl)\n  ```\n- The link path should be relative from the `.md` file location to the split dir\n- Return True if any links were added, False otherwise\n- Do NOT modify lines that already have a source link (idempotent)\n\n#### `patch_all_markdown_in_directory(doc_dir: Path, source_dir: Path | None = None) -> int`\n- Find all `.cbl.md` files in `doc_dir`\n- For each, determine the corresponding `.cbl.d/` directory\n  - Default: sibling of the `.cbl.md` file, named `{PROGRAM}.cbl.d/`\n  - If `source_dir` provided, look there instead\n- Call `patch_markdown_links()` for each\n- Return count of files modified\n\n### 2.

Integration into `ScribePool._save_documentation_template()`\n\nIn `war_rig/workers/scribe_pool.py`, after the markdown is written (~line 2106), add a post-processing step:\n\n```python\n# After md_path.write_text(md_content, encoding=\"utf-8\")\n# Split paragraphs and link them\nfrom war_rig.io.paragraph_splitter import split_paragraphs, patch_markdown_links\n\nsource_path = self.input_directory / file_name\ndoc_json_path = doc_path\nsplit_dir = doc_path.with_suffix(\"\").with_suffix(\"\").parent / f\"{Path(file_name).name}.d\"\n\nif source_path.exists():\n    split_paragraphs(source_path, doc_json_path, output_dir=split_dir)\n    patch_markdown_links(md_path, split_dir)\n```\n\n- This runs for every file after documentation is saved\n- Requires access to `self.input_directory` (source files) which ScribePool already has\n- The split_dir should be a sibling of the .md file: `output/cbl/PROG.cbl.d/`\n- Wrap in try/except with warning log (do not fail the pipeline on splitter errors)\n\n### 2. Integration into `DocumentationWriter.write_result()`\n\nIn `war_rig/io/writer.py`, after writing the final markdown (~line 189):\n\n- Add paragraph splitting and linking as a post-processing step\n- The writer has `self.config.output_directory` and `self.config.input_directory`\n- Same pattern: split paragraphs, then patch the markdown\n\n### 3. CLI batch mode (optional/stretch)\n\nAdd a standalone CLI command or function that can be called on an existing output directory to retroactively split and link all COBOL files:\n\n```python\n# In war_rig/io/paragraph_splitter.py or as CLI subcommand\ndef run_batch_split(input_dir: Path, output_dir: Path) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Split all COBOL paragraphs and patch markdown links.\"\"\"\n    results = split_all_in_directory(source_dir=input_dir, doc_dir=output_dir)\n    count = patch_all_markdown_in_directory(doc_dir=output_dir)\n```\n\nThis enables running the splitter against `example_output/` or any previous run.\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- `ScribePool` has `self.input_directory` (Path to source files) and `self.output_directory` (Path to output)\n- `DocumentationWriter` has `self.config.output_directory` and can access `self.config.input_directory`\n- The `SystemConfig` model is at `war_rig/config.py` -- check if `input_directory` is available\n- The splitter should run for ALL .cbl files (no size threshold)\n- Both JCL and copybook files are out of scope -- COBOL programs only\n- Do NOT split if the source .cbl file is unavailable (just log and continue)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Paragraph splitting runs automatically after each scribe pool doc save\n- [ ] Paragraph splitting runs automatically after `write_result()` in DocumentationWriter\n- [ ] Errors in splitting/linking do not crash the pipeline (warning-level logging)\n- [ ] Batch function exists for retroactive splitting of existing output directories\n- [ ] Integration is gated appropriately (only runs for COBOL files, only when source available)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- war_rig-8q73.1 (Core splitter module)\n- war_rig-8q73.2 (Markdown linker)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-23T07:47:18.153183585-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-02-23T08:03:24.850463412-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-23T08:03:24.850463412-07:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"war_rig-8q73.3","depends_on_id":"war_rig-8q73","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-23T07:47:18.154223175-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe"},{"issue_id":"war_rig-8q73.3","depends_on_id":"war_rig-8q73.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-23T07:47:18.155960383-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe"},{"issue_id":"war_rig-8q73.3","depends_on_id":"war_rig-8q73.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-23T07:47:18.157614285-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe"}]}

{"id":"war_rig-ahce","title":"Remove LangChain/LangGraph dependency and use llm_providers directly","description":"## Problem\n\ncodewhisper's LLM implementation is architecturally wrong. It extracts API keys from llm_providers to create LangChain/LangGraph models, rather than using llm_providers directly as designed.\n\n### Current (Wrong) Approach in codewhisper\n\nThe `langchain_factory.py` extracts private attributes from llm_providers to create LangChain models:\n\n```python\n# langchain_factory.py - WRONG\nfrom llm_providers import get_provider_from_env\n\nprovider = get_provider_from_env(provider_name=provider_name)\n\n# Extracting private attrs - breaks encapsulation\nif \"anthropic\" in provider_class_name:\n    resolved_name = \"anthropic\"\n    api_key = provider._api_key  # <-- BAD: accessing private attribute\n    extra_config = {\n        \"default_model\": provider._default_model,\n        \"max_tokens\": provider._max_tokens,\n    }\n\n# Then creates a separate LangChain model\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\nreturn ChatAnthropic(api_key=api_key, model=resolved_model, ...)\n```\n\n### War_rig (Correct) Approach\n\nWar_rig uses providers directly via the `LLMProvider` protocol:\n\n```python\n# war_rig/providers/protocol.py - CORRECT pattern\nfrom llm_providers import get_provider_from_env, Message\n\nprovider = get_provider_from_env()\nmessages = [Message(role=\"system\", content=\"...\"), Message(role=\"user\", content=\"...\")]\nresponse = await provider.complete(messages)  # Uses provider directly\nprint(response.content)\n```\n\n### Why This Is Wrong\n\n1. **Breaks encapsulation**: Accessing `provider._api_key`, `provider._default_model` etc.\n2. **Duplicates logic**: LangChain model creation duplicates what llm_providers already does\n3. **Increases dependencies**: Adds langchain-core, langchain-anthropic, langchain-openai, langgraph\n4. **Maintenance burden**: Must update LangChain-specific code when providers change\n5. **Inconsistency**: codewhisper behaves differently from rest of war_rig ecosystem\n\n## Required Fix\n\nRemove LangChain/LangGraph as dependencies and use llm_providers directly, following the established war_rig patterns.\n\n## Files to Change\n\n### Primary Files (must rewrite)\n\n1. **src/codewhisper/agent/langchain_factory.py** - DELETE or completely rewrite\n   - Remove all LangChain imports\n   - Remove `_get_provider_info_from_llm_providers()` that extracts private attrs\n   - Remove `_create_openrouter_model()`, `_create_anthropic_model()`, `_create_openai_model()`\n   - If needed, create a thin wrapper that uses llm_providers directly\n\n2. **src/codewhisper/agent/graph.py** - Major rewrite needed\n   - Remove LangGraph StateGraph usage\n   - Remove imports: `langgraph.graph`, `langgraph.prebuilt`\n   - Remove LangChain message types: `AIMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `SystemMessage`, `ToolMessage`\n   - Rewrite `CodeWhisperAgent` to use llm_providers directly\n   - Rewrite the agent loop without LangGraph's StateGraph pattern\n   - Implement tool calling using provider.complete() responses\n\n3. **src/codewhisper/agent/minion.py** - Moderate rewrite\n   - Remove `from langchain_core.runnables import Runnable`\n   - Remove `llm.with_structured_output(ToolResultSummary)` pattern\n   - Rewrite `_create_llm()` to use llm_providers\n   - Implement structured output parsing manually (JSON mode or prompt engineering)\n\n### Secondary Files (may need updates)\n\n4. **src/codewhisper/agent/state.py** - Review for LangChain types\n5. **src/codewhisper/agent/tools.py** - Review for LangChain tool decorators\n6. **src/codewhisper/agent/citadel_tools.py** - Review for LangChain tool decorators\n7. **src/codewhisper/agent/__init__.py** - Update exports\n\n### pyproject.toml\n\nRemove these dependencies:\n- `langgraph>=0.2.0`\n- `langchain-core>=0.3.0`\n- `langchain-anthropic>=0.2.0`\n- `langchain-openai>=0.2.0`\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n\n### Agent Loop Pattern\n\nInstead of LangGraph's StateGraph, implement a simple ReAct-style loop:\n\n```python\nfrom llm_providers import get_provider_from_env, Message\n\nclass CodeWhisperAgent:\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        self.provider = get_provider_from_env()\n        self.tools = get_all_tools()\n    \n    async def chat(self, user_message: str) -> str:\n        messages = [\n            Message(role=\"system\", content=SYSTEM_PROMPT),\n            Message(role=\"user\", content=user_message),\n        ]\n        \n        while True:\n            response = await self.provider.complete(messages)\n            \n            # Parse response for tool calls (could use JSON mode or markers)\n            tool_calls = self._parse_tool_calls(response.content)\n            \n            if not tool_calls:\n                return response.content\n            \n            # Execute tools and add results to context\n            for tool_call in tool_calls:\n                result = await self._execute_tool(tool_call)\n                messages.append(Message(role=\"assistant\", content=f\"Tool: {tool_call}\"))\n                messages.append(Message(role=\"user\", content=f\"Result: {result}\"))\n            \n            # Continue loop for next LLM call\n```\n\n### Tool Calling\n\nReplace LangChain's tool decorators with simple function definitions and prompt-based tool selection, or use provider-specific tool calling features through llm_providers if available.\n\n### Structured Output\n\nReplace `llm.with_structured_output()` with:\n1. JSON mode prompting\n2. Manual parsing of LLM responses\n3. Pydantic model validation of parsed JSON\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] No imports from langchain_*, langgraph in codewhisper\n- [ ] No LangChain/LangGraph in pyproject.toml dependencies\n- [ ] All agent functionality works using llm_providers.complete() directly\n- [ ] Tests pass without LangChain dependencies\n- [ ] Tool execution works without LangChain tool decorators\n- [ ] Minion summarization works without structured_output","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-04T10:14:48.339686249-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-02-04T10:33:27.78124503-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-04T10:33:27.78124503-07:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

New tests must cover the structural pre-check feature end-to-end: Citadel context loading, comparison logic, and integration into the validation pipeline. Follow the existing test patterns (pytest fixtures, MagicMock/AsyncMock, patching).\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Add tests in tests/test_workers/test_challenger_pool.py (or create a new file tests/test_workers/test_structural_precheck.py if the logic was extracted to a separate module).\n\n2. Test cases for _get_citadel_context():\n   - Test successful context loading (mock Citadel SDK analyze_file/get_functions/get_includes)\n   - Test graceful None return when Citadel unavailable (self._citadel is None)\n   - Test graceful None return on Citadel exception\n\n3. Test cases for _run_structural_precheck():\n   a. **Missing paragraphs**: Create a citadel_context with 5 paragraphs and a template with 3 paragraphs. Assert 2 BLOCKING ChallengerQuestion objects are returned with question_type=COMPLETENESS.\n   b. **No missing paragraphs**: citadel_context and template have the same paragraphs. Assert empty list returned.\n   c. **Dead code exclusion**: citadel_context has 5 paragraphs, 1 is dead code. Template has 3 paragraphs. Assert only 1 issue (not 2) -- dead code paragraph is excluded.\n   d. **PERFORM THRU exclusion**: Verify paragraphs in the THRU targets set are excluded from missing paragraph detection.\n   e. **Missing calls**: Citadel says paragraph X performs Y and Z, template paragraph X only lists Y. Assert 1 IMPORTANT issue about missing call to Z.\n   f. **Missing copybook**: Citadel includes [\"CPYBOOK1\", \"CPYBOOK2\"], template.copybooks_used has only CPYBOOK1. Assert 1 IMPORTANT issue.\n   g. **Empty sections**: Template has empty inputs list and None purpose.summary. Assert BLOCKING issue for purpose, IMPORTANT for inputs.\n   h. **Case insensitivity**: Citadel has \"MAIN-PROCESS\", template has \"main-process\". Assert no false positive.\n\n4. Test cases for integration into _validate_documentation():\n   a. **Structural issues prepended to LLM issues**: Mock both pre-check (returns 1 issue) and LLM (returns 1 issue). Assert final blocking_questions has 2 items, structural one first.\n   b. **LLM skipped on heavy structural blocking**: Pre-check returns 3+ BLOCKING issues. Assert ChallengerAgent.ainvoke() was NOT called.\n   c. **No Citadel available**: Ensure validation runs with LLM-only path when Citadel is None (backwards compatible).\n   d. **Discovery tickets bypass pre-check**: Verify _process_discovery_validation does not invoke pre-check.\n\n5. All tests must pass with: uv run pytest tests/test_workers/test_challenger_pool.py -x (or the new test file)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- All test cases listed above are implemented and passing\n- Tests use mocking (do not require actual Citadel or source files)\n- Tests follow existing patterns in tests/test_workers/test_challenger_pool.py\n- No flaky tests (all deterministic, no timing dependencies)\n- ruff check passes on test files\n- mypy passes on test files\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- tests/test_workers/test_challenger_pool.py (extend) OR tests/test_workers/test_structural_precheck.py (new)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: war_rig-ylbu, war_rig-v8pf, war_rig-09jq (all implementation tickets)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T15:17:16.474588155-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-01-27T15:27:26.609263429-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T15:27:26.609267006-07:00"}

{"id":"war_rig-v8pf","title":"Implement structural pre-check comparison logic","description":"## Context\n\nThis ticket implements the core comparison logic that takes Citadel structural facts and the Scribe's DocumentationTemplate and produces a list of ChallengerQuestion objects for structural gaps. This is a pure function with no side effects -- it takes data in and returns issues out.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Create a new method _run_structural_precheck(self, citadel_context: dict, template: DocumentationTemplate, file_name: str) -> list[ChallengerQuestion] on ChallengerWorker (or as a standalone function in a new module war_rig/workers/structural_precheck.py -- implementer's choice).\n\n2. The method must perform these comparisons:\n\n   a. **Missing paragraphs check**: Compare Citadel paragraph names (from citadel_context[\"paragraphs\"]) against template.paragraphs (list[Paragraph], model at war_rig/models/templates.py line 436). Match by paragraph_name field (case-insensitive). For any Citadel paragraph not found in the template, generate a ChallengerQuestion with:\n      - section = \"paragraphs\"\n      - question_type = QuestionType.COMPLETENESS (from war_rig/models/tickets.py line 55)\n      - severity = QuestionSeverity.BLOCKING (line 65)\n      - question = descriptive text naming the missing paragraph and its line range\n      - evidence = [line_start] from Citadel data\n      - Exclude paragraphs marked as dead code (is_dead_code=True or in citadel_context[\"dead_code\"]). Also exclude PERFORM THRU range endpoints.\n\n   b. **Missing calls check**: For each paragraph present in BOTH Citadel and the template, compare Citadel outgoing calls (callout.target where callout.relationship == \"performs\") against template paragraph's calls field (list[str]) AND outgoing_calls field (list[FunctionCall]). If Citadel says paragraph X performs Y but the template paragraph X does not list Y in calls or outgoing_calls, generate:\n      - section = \"paragraphs\"\n      - question_type = QuestionType.COMPLETENESS\n      - severity = QuestionSeverity.IMPORTANT\n      - question = text naming the missing call relationship\n      - evidence = [callout.line] if available\n\n   c. **Missing copybook references check**: Compare Citadel includes (citadel_context[\"includes\"]) against template.copybooks_used (list[CopybookReference], model at templates.py line 370). Match by copybook_name (case-insensitive). For any Citadel include not in the template, generate:\n      - section = \"copybooks_used\"\n      - question_type = QuestionType.COMPLETENESS\n      - severity = QuestionSeverity.IMPORTANT\n\n   d. **Empty critical sections check**: Check if these template sections are empty/null:\n      - template.inputs (list) -- empty list\n      - template.outputs (list) -- empty list\n      - template.business_rules (list) -- empty list\n      - template.purpose -- None or purpose.summary is None/empty\n      Generate QuestionType.COMPLETENESS with severity BLOCKING for empty purpose, IMPORTANT for others.\n\n3. Each generated ChallengerQuestion must have a unique question_id (use generate_question_id() from war_rig/models/tickets.py line 90) and iteration=1 (or accept iteration as parameter).\n\n4. Return the list sorted by severity (BLOCKING first, then IMPORTANT).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Function correctly identifies missing paragraphs (excluding dead code and THRU targets)\n- Function correctly identifies missing call relationships per-paragraph\n- Function correctly identifies missing copybook references\n- Function correctly identifies empty critical sections\n- All returned objects are valid ChallengerQuestion instances\n- Dead code paragraphs are excluded from the missing paragraphs check\n- Case-insensitive matching for paragraph and copybook names\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- war_rig/workers/challenger_pool.py (new method) OR war_rig/workers/structural_precheck.py (new module)\n- Imports from: war_rig/models/tickets.py (ChallengerQuestion, QuestionType, QuestionSeverity, generate_question_id)\n- Imports from: war_rig/models/templates.py (DocumentationTemplate, Paragraph, CopybookReference)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on ticket: war_rig-ylbu (Citadel context loading -- defines the citadel_context dict structure)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T15:16:16.018416425-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-01-27T15:24:07.95444183-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T15:24:07.95444183-07:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

{"id":"war_rig-ylbu","title":"Add Citadel context loading to ChallengerWorker","description":"## Context\n\nThe ChallengerWorker (challenger_pool.py) currently does not use Citadel static analysis at all. The ScribeWorker already has a pattern for loading Citadel context -- see _get_citadel_context() at line 336 of scribe_pool.py, which calls citadel.get_functions() and citadel.get_includes(). We need an equivalent capability in the ChallengerWorker so the structural pre-check can access ground-truth paragraph names, call relationships, and copybook includes.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Add a Citadel SDK import and initialization to ChallengerWorker.__init__() (file: war_rig/workers/challenger_pool.py, line ~132-177). Follow the same pattern as ScribeWorker which initializes self._citadel in __init__ and gracefully handles the case where Citadel is unavailable (returns None).\n\n2. Add a _get_citadel_context(self, file_path: str) method to ChallengerWorker that:\n   - Calls self._citadel.analyze_file(file_path) to get a FileAnalysisResult (see citadel/src/citadel/sdk.py line 227)\n   - Extracts: list of paragraph/function names with line ranges (FileArtifact.name, line_start, line_end), per-paragraph outgoing callouts (FileArtifact.callouts -> Callout.target, relationship, line), and preprocessor includes (FileAnalysisResult.preprocessor_includes)\n   - Returns a structured dict or dataclass with: paragraphs (list of {name, line_start, line_end, calls: [{target, type, line}]}), includes (list of str), dead_code (list of dict -- from cached dead code, same pattern as ScribeWorker)\n   - Returns None gracefully if Citadel unavailable or analysis fails (log at debug level)\n\n3. The file_path for Citadel must be resolved from ticket metadata. See _load_documentation_state() line 676-678 which reads metadata[\"file_path\"]. Alternatively, resolve from ticket.file_name + config input_directory, same as ScribeWorker line 658-661.\n\n4. Add _find_perform_thru_targets(self, file_path: str) -> set[str] method (copy pattern from scribe_pool.py line 434-466) -- needed to filter false positive dead code from structural check.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- ChallengerWorker has self._citadel attribute initialized in __init__ (None if Citadel unavailable)\n- _get_citadel_context returns structured data with paragraphs, includes, dead_code\n- Method handles errors gracefully (returns None, logs debug)\n- _find_perform_thru_targets reuses the PERFORM THRU regex pattern from ScribeWorker\n- No new external dependencies required (Citadel SDK is already in the project)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- war_rig/workers/challenger_pool.py (ChallengerWorker class)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone -- this is the foundational ticket.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T15:15:51.08794514-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-01-27T15:24:07.828196984-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T15:24:07.828196984-07:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
