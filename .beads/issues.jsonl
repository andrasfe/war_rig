{"id":"war_rig-7gsl","title":"Root cause analysis: Why Scribe sends 35K tokens without truncation","description":"## Problem\n\nThe Scribe agent is sending ~35K tokens when it should be limiting prompts to ~15K tokens (the configured `scribe_max_prompt_tokens` default).\n\n## Root Cause Hypothesis (Based on Investigation)\n\n**The token limiting logic was never implemented or was removed.**\n\nEvidence from code analysis:\n\n### 1. Config Defines Limits but They're Unused\n\n```python\n# In config.py (lines 73-76, 191-194)\nclass ScribeConfig(ModelConfig):\n    max_prompt_tokens: int = Field(\n        default=15000,\n        description=\"Maximum approximate tokens for the prompt (will truncate content to fit)\",\n    )\n```\n\nThe description says 'will truncate content to fit' but **NO CODE DOES THIS**.\n\n### 2. ScribeAgent Never Reads max_prompt_tokens\n\nIn `scribe.py`, the ScribeAgent:\n- Takes a `ScribeConfig` in __init__ but only uses `config.model` and `config.temperature`\n- `_build_user_prompt()` method builds the full prompt without any truncation\n- Simply concatenates: file info + preprocessor JSON + full source code + copybooks + previous template + questions\n\n### 3. Source Code Is Added Without Any Size Check\n\n```python\n# In scribe.py lines 352-360\n# Source code\nparts.append(\"## Source Code\")\nparts.append(\"\\`\\`\\`\")\nlines = input_data.source_code.split(\"\\n\")\nfor i, line in enumerate(lines, start=1):\n    parts.append(f\"{i:5d} | {line}\")  # ALL lines, no limit\\!\nparts.append(\"\\`\\`\\`\")\n```\n\n### 4. Chunking Logic Was Removed\n\nGit commit `ea26209` (Jan 19, 2026) removed the Atlas chunking framework:\n- Deleted war_rig/chunking/ directory\n- Deleted routing logic that would have split large files\n- The commit message says 'Atlas was a planned but never implemented chunking orchestration system'\n\n## Confirmed Root Cause\n\n**The token limiting was designed but never implemented. The config field `scribe_max_prompt_tokens` is a placeholder that is completely unused by the actual code.**\n\nThe chunking framework that would have handled large files was removed because it was 'non-functional dead code'.\n\n## Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier\n\n- Small COBOL files (most are under 2000 lines) work fine\n- The ~35K token limit is only hit by large programs\n- No automated tests verify token limits are respected\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- war_rig-dowu: Investigation ticket (parent)\n- war_rig-ekkk: Epic for Atlas chunking embedding (still open but work was removed)","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-21T09:37:59.782357158-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-01-21T09:37:59.782357158-07:00","labels":["bug","root-cause","scribe","token-limit"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"war_rig-7gsl","depends_on_id":"war_rig-dowu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-21T09:37:59.784958787-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe"}]}

{"id":"war_rig-cr7p","title":"Fix: Implement token limiting in Scribe agent for large files","description":"## Problem\n\nThe Scribe agent sends ~35K tokens for large files, exceeding context limits. The `scribe_max_prompt_tokens` config exists but is completely unused.\n\n## Solution Options\n\n### Option A: Simple Truncation (Quick Fix)\n\nAdd token estimation and truncation to `ScribeAgent._build_user_prompt()`:\n\n```python\ndef _build_user_prompt(self, input_data: ScribeInput) -\u003e str:\n    # ... existing code ...\n    \n    # Estimate tokens and truncate source if needed\n    max_tokens = self.config.max_prompt_tokens  # Use existing config!\n    \n    # Rough estimate: 4 chars per token for code\n    source_lines = input_data.source_code.split(\"\\n\")\n    estimated_tokens = len(input_data.source_code) // 4\n    \n    if estimated_tokens \u003e max_tokens * 0.7:  # Leave room for other content\n        # Truncate from middle, keeping start and end\n        max_source_chars = int(max_tokens * 0.7 * 4)\n        # Keep first 40% and last 20%\n        keep_start = int(max_source_chars * 0.4)\n        keep_end = int(max_source_chars * 0.2)\n        truncated = (\n            input_data.source_code[:keep_start] +\n            \"\\n... [TRUNCATED - file too large] ...\\n\" +\n            input_data.source_code[-keep_end:]\n        )\n        source_lines = truncated.split(\"\\n\")\n```\n\n**Pros**: Simple, fast to implement\n**Cons**: Loses context, may produce incomplete documentation\n\n### Option B: Semantic Chunking (Proper Fix)\n\nRe-implement chunking based on the removed Atlas framework:\n\n1. **Detect large files** in ScribeWorkerPool before calling ScribeAgent\n2. **Split by COBOL divisions/sections** using preprocessor hints\n3. **Process chunks separately** with focused prompts\n4. **Merge documentation** from chunks into unified template\n\n**Pros**: Preserves all context, better documentation quality\n**Cons**: Complex, requires restoring chunking infrastructure\n\n### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)\n\n1. **Immediate**: Implement Option A as a stopgap\n2. **Follow-up**: Implement proper chunking for COBOL files\n\n## Implementation Plan for Option A (Stopgap)\n\n### Changes Required\n\n1. **scribe.py** - Modify `_build_user_prompt()`:\n   - Add token estimation\n   - Truncate source code if over limit\n   - Log warning when truncation occurs\n\n2. **scribe.py** - Add truncation helper method:\n   - `_truncate_source_code(source: str, max_chars: int) -\u003e str`\n   - Keep paragraph headers visible\n   - Add truncation markers\n\n3. **Unit tests** - Add tests for:\n   - Normal files (no truncation)\n   - Large files (truncation occurs)\n   - Token estimation accuracy\n\n### Files to Modify\n\n- `/home/andras/war_rig/war_rig/agents/scribe.py`\n- `/home/andras/war_rig/tests/test_agents/test_scribe.py`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Large files (\u003e15K estimated tokens) are truncated before sending to LLM\n- [ ] Warning is logged when truncation occurs\n- [ ] Truncation preserves file structure (keeps important markers)\n- [ ] Config field `scribe_max_prompt_tokens` is actually used\n- [ ] Unit tests cover truncation logic\n- [ ] No regression in normal file processing\n\n## Future Work\n\nConsider re-implementing proper chunking after this fix is in place:\n- war_rig-ekkk: Epic for Atlas chunking (still open)\n- May need new approach since Atlas was 'never implemented'","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"andrasf94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-21T09:38:20.137406254-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe","updated_at":"2026-01-21T09:38:20.137406254-07:00","labels":["bug","fix","scribe","token-limit"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"war_rig-cr7p","depends_on_id":"war_rig-7gsl","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-21T09:38:20.139821664-07:00","created_by":"andrasfe"}]}
