When ticket has metadata.discovery=True: (1) Search input_dir for files matching program_id, (2) If found as file, process as normal documentation, (3) If not found as file, call _search_symbol_in_sources(). Files to modify: war_rig/workers/scribe_pool.py. Acceptance criteria: Discovery tickets detected and handled specially; File search covers all extensions; Symbol search finds CALL, PERFORM, CICS patterns."}
